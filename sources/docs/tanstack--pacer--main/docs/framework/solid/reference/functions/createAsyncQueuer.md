```ts
function createAsyncQueuer<TValue, TSelected>(
   fn,
   options?,
selector?): SolidAsyncQueuer<TValue, TSelected>;
```

Defined in: [async-queuer/createAsyncQueuer.ts:189](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/solid-pacer/src/async-queuer/createAsyncQueuer.ts#L189)

Creates a Solid-compatible AsyncQueuer instance for managing an asynchronous queue of items, exposing Solid signals for all stateful properties.

Features:
- Priority queueing via `getPriority` or item `priority` property
- Configurable concurrency limit
- FIFO (First In First Out) or LIFO (Last In First Out) queue behavior
- Pause/resume processing
- Task cancellation
- Item expiration
- Lifecycle callbacks for success, error, settled, items change, etc.
- All stateful properties (active items, pending items, counts, etc.) are exposed as Solid signals for reactivity

Tasks are processed concurrently up to the configured concurrency limit. When a task completes,
the next pending task is processed if the concurrency limit allows.

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and queuer instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together; the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncQueuer instance

## State Management and Selector

The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. You can subscribe to state changes
in two ways:

**1. Using `queuer.Subscribe` component (Recommended for component tree subscriptions)**

Use the `Subscribe` component to subscribe to state changes deep in your component tree without
needing to pass a selector to the hook. This is ideal when you want to subscribe to state
in child components.

**2. Using the `selector` parameter (For hook-level subscriptions)**

The `selector` parameter allows you to specify which state changes will trigger reactive updates
at the hook level, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary updates when irrelevant
state changes occur.

**By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
tracking by providing a selector function or using the `Subscribe` component. This prevents unnecessary
updates and gives you full control over when your component tracks state changes.

Available state properties:
- `activeItems`: Array of items currently being processed
- `errorCount`: Number of items that failed processing
- `isRunning`: Whether the queuer is currently running (not stopped)
- `items`: Array of items waiting to be processed
- `rejectionCount`: Number of items that were rejected (expired or failed validation)
- `settleCount`: Number of items that have completed processing (successful or failed)
- `successCount`: Number of items that were processed successfully

## Unmount behavior

By default, the primitive stops the queuer and aborts any in-flight task executions when the owning component unmounts.
Abort only cancels underlying operations (e.g. fetch) when the abort signal from `getAbortSignal()` is passed to them.
Use the `onUnmount` option to customize this. For example, to flush pending items instead:

```tsx
const queuer = createAsyncQueuer(fn, {
  concurrency: 2,
  started: false,
  onUnmount: (q) => q.flush()
});
```

Note: For async utils, `flush()` returns a Promise and runs fire-and-forget in the cleanup.
If your task function updates Solid signals, those updates may run after the component has
unmounted, which can cause unexpected reactive updates. Guard your callbacks accordingly when
using onUnmount with flush.

Example usage:
```tsx
// Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
const asyncQueuer = createAsyncQueuer(async (item) => {
  // process item
  return await fetchData(item);
}, {
  initialItems: [],
  concurrency: 2,
  maxSize: 100,
  started: false,
  onSuccess: (result) => {
    console.log('Item processed:', result);
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('Processing failed:', error);
  }
});

// Opt-in to track queue state changes (optimized for UI updates)
const asyncQueuer = createAsyncQueuer(
  async (item) => await fetchData(item),
  { concurrency: 2, started: true },
  (state) => ({
    items: state.items,
    activeItems: state.activeItems,
    isRunning: state.isRunning
  })
);

// Opt-in to track processing metrics changes (optimized for tracking progress)
const asyncQueuer = createAsyncQueuer(
  async (item) => await fetchData(item),
  { concurrency: 2, started: true },
  (state) => ({
    successCount: state.successCount,
    errorCount: state.errorCount,
    settleCount: state.settleCount
  })
);

// Add items to queue
asyncQueuer.addItem(newItem);

// Start processing
asyncQueuer.start();

// Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
const { items, activeItems } = asyncQueuer.state();
```
