```ts
function createAsyncRateLimiter<TFn, TSelected>(
   fn,
   options,
selector?): SolidAsyncRateLimiter<TFn, TSelected>;
```

Defined in: [async-rate-limiter/createAsyncRateLimiter.ts:228](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/solid-pacer/src/async-rate-limiter/createAsyncRateLimiter.ts#L228)

A low-level Solid hook that creates an `AsyncRateLimiter` instance to limit how many times an async function can execute within a time window.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a rate limiter instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, etc).

Rate limiting is a simple approach that allows a function to execute up to a limit within a time window,
then blocks all subsequent calls until the window passes. This can lead to "bursty" behavior where
all executions happen immediately, followed by a complete block.

The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
- 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
  towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
- 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
  consistent rate of execution over time.

Unlike the non-async RateLimiter, this async version supports returning values from the rate-limited function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the rate-limited function.

For smoother execution patterns, consider using:
- Throttling: Ensures consistent spacing between executions (e.g. max once per 200ms)
- Debouncing: Waits for a pause in calls before executing (e.g. after 500ms of no calls)

Rate limiting is best used for hard API limits or resource constraints. For UI updates or
smoothing out frequent events, throttling or debouncing usually provide better user experience.

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and rate limiter instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncRateLimiter instance
- Rate limit rejections (when limit is exceeded) are handled separately from execution errors via the `onReject` handler

## State Management and Selector

The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. You can subscribe to state changes
in two ways:

**1. Using `rateLimiter.Subscribe` component (Recommended for component tree subscriptions)**

Use the `Subscribe` component to subscribe to state changes deep in your component tree without
needing to pass a selector to the hook. This is ideal when you want to subscribe to state
in child components.

**2. Using the `selector` parameter (For hook-level subscriptions)**

The `selector` parameter allows you to specify which state changes will trigger reactive updates
at the hook level, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary updates when irrelevant
state changes occur.

**By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
tracking by providing a selector function or using the `Subscribe` component. This prevents unnecessary
updates and gives you full control over when your component tracks state changes.

Use `getRemainingInWindow()` and `getMsUntilNextWindow()` for current window capacity and timing.

Available state properties:
- `executionTimes`: Timestamps of executions tracked for the current window
- `isExceeded`: Whether the rate limit has been reached
- `settleCount`: Number of function executions that have completed (success or error)
- `errorCount`: Number of function executions that have resulted in errors
- `isExecuting`: Whether an async function execution is currently in progress
- `lastResult`: The result from the most recent successful execution
- `rejectionCount`: Number of function calls that were rejected due to rate limiting

## Unmount behavior

By default, the primitive aborts any in-flight execution when the owning component unmounts.
Abort only cancels underlying operations (e.g. fetch) when the abort signal from `getAbortSignal()` is passed to them.
Use the `onUnmount` option to customize this.

## Example

```tsx
// Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
const asyncRateLimiter = createAsyncRateLimiter(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data; // Return value is preserved
  },
  { limit: 5, window: 1000 } // 5 calls per second
);

// Subscribe to state changes deep in component tree using Subscribe component
<asyncRateLimiter.Subscribe selector={(state) => ({ rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount, isExecuting: state.isExecuting })}>
  {(state) => (
    <div>Rejected: {state().rejectionCount}, {state().isExecuting ? 'Executing' : 'Idle'}</div>
  )}
</asyncRateLimiter.Subscribe>

// Opt-in to track execution state changes at hook level (optimized for loading indicators)
const asyncRateLimiter = createAsyncRateLimiter(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  { limit: 5, window: 1000 },
  (state) => ({ isExecuting: state.isExecuting })
);

// Opt-in to track results when available (optimized for data display)
const asyncRateLimiter = createAsyncRateLimiter(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  { limit: 5, window: 1000 },
  (state) => ({
    lastResult: state.lastResult,
    successCount: state.successCount
  })
);

// Opt-in to track error/rejection state changes (optimized for error handling)
const asyncRateLimiter = createAsyncRateLimiter(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  {
    limit: 5,
    window: 1000,
    onError: (error) => console.error('API call failed:', error),
    onReject: (rateLimiter) => console.log('Rate limit exceeded')
  },
  (state) => ({
    errorCount: state.errorCount,
    rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount
  })
);

// Opt-in to track execution metrics changes (optimized for stats display)
const asyncRateLimiter = createAsyncRateLimiter(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  { limit: 5, window: 1000 },
  (state) => ({
    successCount: state.successCount,
    errorCount: state.errorCount,
    settleCount: state.settleCount,
    rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount
  })
);

// Opt-in to track execution times changes (optimized for window calculations)
const asyncRateLimiter = createAsyncRateLimiter(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  { limit: 5, window: 1000 },
  (state) => ({ executionTimes: state.executionTimes })
);

// Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
const { isExecuting, lastResult, rejectionCount } = asyncRateLimiter.state();
```
