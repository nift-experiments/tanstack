```ts
function useDebouncedCallback<TFn>(fn, options): (...args) => void;
```

Defined in: [debouncer/useDebouncedCallback.ts:42](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/preact-pacer/src/debouncer/useDebouncedCallback.ts#L42)

A Preact hook that creates a debounced version of a callback function.
This hook is essentially a wrapper around the basic `debounce` function
that is exported from `@tanstack/pacer`,
but optimized for Preact with reactive options and a stable function reference.

The debounced function will only execute after the specified wait time has elapsed
since its last invocation. If called again before the wait time expires, the timer
resets and starts waiting again.

This hook provides a simpler API compared to `useDebouncer`, making it ideal for basic
debouncing needs. However, it does not expose the underlying Debouncer instance.

For advanced usage requiring features like:
- Manual cancellation
- Access to execution counts
- Custom useCallback dependencies

Consider using the `useDebouncer` hook instead.

## Type Parameters

`TFn`

### options

[`PreactDebouncerOptions`](../interfaces/PreactDebouncerOptions.md)\<`TFn`, \{
\}\>

## Example

```tsx

const handleSearch = useDebouncedCallback((query: string) => {
  fetchSearchResults(query);
}, {

});

// Use in an input
<input
  type="search"
  onChange={(e) => handleSearch(e.target.value)}
