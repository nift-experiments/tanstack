```ts
function asyncQueue<TValue>(fn, initialOptions): (item, position, runOnItemsChange) => boolean;
```

Defined in: [async-queuer.ts:982](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/pacer/src/async-queuer.ts#L982)

Creates a new AsyncQueuer instance and returns a bound addItem function for adding tasks.
The queuer is started automatically and ready to process items.

Async vs Sync Versions:
The async version provides advanced features over the sync queue function:
- Returns promises that can be awaited for task results
- Built-in retry support via AsyncRetryer integration for each queued task
- Abort support to cancel in-flight task executions
- Comprehensive error handling with onError callbacks and throwOnError control
- Detailed execution tracking (success/error/settle counts)
- Concurrent execution support (process multiple items simultaneously)

The sync queue function is lighter weight and simpler when you don't need async features,
return values, or execution control.

What is Queuing?
Queuing is a technique for managing and processing items sequentially or with controlled concurrency.
Tasks are processed up to the configured concurrency limit. When a task completes,
the next pending task is processed if the concurrency limit allows.

Configuration Options:
- `concurrency`: Maximum number of concurrent tasks (default: 1)
- `wait`: Time to wait between processing items (default: 0)
- `maxSize`: Maximum number of items allowed in the queue (default: Infinity)
- `getPriority`: Function to determine item priority
- `addItemsTo`: Default position to add items ('back' or 'front', default: 'back')
- `getItemsFrom`: Default position to get items ('front' or 'back', default: 'front')
- `expirationDuration`: Maximum time items can stay in queue
- `started`: Whether to start processing immediately (default: true)
- `asyncRetryerOptions`: Configure retry behavior for task executions

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and queuer instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together; the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncQueuer instance

State Management:
- Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
- Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the async queuer
- Use `onSuccess` callback to react to successful task execution and implement custom logic
- Use `onError` callback to react to task execution errors and implement custom error handling
- Use `onSettled` callback to react to task execution completion (success or error) and implement custom logic
- Use `onItemsChange` callback to react to items being added or removed from the queue
- Use `onExpire` callback to react to items expiring and implement custom logic
- Use `onReject` callback to react to items being rejected when the queue is full
- The state includes error count, expiration count, rejection count, running status, and success/settle counts
- State can be accessed via the underlying AsyncQueuer instance's `store.state` property
- When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from the hook's state property

## Type Parameters

### TValue

`TValue`

## Parameters

### fn

(`value`) => `Promise`\<`any`\>

### initialOptions

[`AsyncQueuerOptions`](../interfaces/AsyncQueuerOptions.md)\<`TValue`\>

## Returns

```ts
(
   item,
   position?,
   runOnItemsChange?): boolean;
```

Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, the item is rejected and onReject is called.
Items can be inserted based on priority or at the front/back depending on configuration.
`undefined` cannot be queued (it is the internal "no item" sentinel) and is always rejected.

### Parameters

#### item

`TValue`

#### position?

[`QueuePosition`](../type-aliases/QueuePosition.md) = `...`

#### runOnItemsChange?

`boolean` = `true`

### Returns

`boolean`

### Example

```ts
queuer.addItem({ value: 'task', priority: 10 });
queuer.addItem('task2', 'front');
```

## Example

```ts
const enqueue = asyncQueue<string>(async (item) => {
  return item.toUpperCase();
}, {
  concurrency: 2,
  wait: 100,
  onSuccess: (result) => console.log('Processed:', result)
});

enqueue('hello');
```
