You're reading a `chat()` stream and you've hit a `CUSTOM` event — maybe
[`sandbox.file.diff`](../sandbox/events), maybe a Code Mode progress event,
maybe `structured-output.complete`. Each feature page documents its own
events in context. This page is the map: every `CUSTOM` event TanStack AI
itself emits, in one table, plus the type mechanism that lets you read any of
them with a plain `if` — no helper function, no cast.

## The type: `ChatStream`

`chat()` returns `ChatStream` by default (no `outputSchema`, `stream` not
explicitly `false`):

```ts
import { chat } from "@tanstack/ai";
import { openaiText } from "@tanstack/ai-openai";
import type { ChatStream } from "@tanstack/ai";

const stream: ChatStream = chat({
  adapter: openaiText("gpt-5.5"),
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }],
});
```

`ChatStream` is defined as:

```ts ignore
type ChatStream = AsyncIterable<Exclude<StreamChunk, CustomEvent> | KnownCustomEvent>
```

`StreamChunk` (the raw AG-UI event union) has exactly one `CUSTOM`-shaped
member: the generic `CustomEvent` interface, with `name: string` and
`value: any`. Left in the union unchanged, that single `any` "poisons" every
narrow — even `if (chunk.type === 'CUSTOM' && chunk.name === 'sandbox.file')`
would still leave `chunk.value` typed `any`, because TypeScript can't
distinguish the generic member from a specific one once they're merged.
`ChatStream` fixes this in two steps: `Exclude<StreamChunk, CustomEvent>`
removes that generic member, and `| KnownCustomEvent` adds back a
discriminated union of every event TanStack AI actually emits — each with a
literal `name` and a concrete `value`. The result is a stream where `CUSTOM`
events narrow like anything else.

## Reading events: the plain narrowing pattern

Check `chunk.type === 'CUSTOM'`, then compare `chunk.name` to a literal
string. That's the entire client-side API — there is no `isCustomEvent` or
`isSandboxEvent` guard to import:

```ts ignore
import { chat } from "@tanstack/ai";
import { openaiText } from "@tanstack/ai-openai";

const stream = chat({
  adapter: openaiText("gpt-5.5"),
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }],
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  if (chunk.type === "CUSTOM" && chunk.name === "sandbox.file.diff") {
    console.log(chunk.value.path, chunk.value.diff); // typed, no helper, no cast
  } else if (chunk.type === "CUSTOM" && chunk.name === "structured-output.complete") {
    console.log(chunk.value.object); // typed, no helper, no cast
  }
}
```

## Full taxonomy

Every interface below extends the base `CustomEvent` (`type: 'CUSTOM'`, plus
an optional `model?`) with a literal `name` and a concrete `value`. All are
unioned as `KnownCustomEvent`, exported from `@tanstack/ai` alongside each
individual interface.

| Interface | `name` | `value` | Emitted when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SandboxFileCustomEvent` | `sandbox.file` | `{ type: 'create' \| 'change' \| 'delete'; path: string; timestamp: number }` | per file create/change/delete in an active [sandbox](../sandbox/events) |
| `SandboxFileDiffEvent` | `sandbox.file.diff` | `{ path: string; diff: string }` | per file change, opt-in via `fileEvents: { diff: true }` |
| `FileChangedEvent` | `file.changed` | `{ path: string; diff: string }` | a harness adapter (Grok Build, Claude Code, …), once after the run completes |
| `SessionIdEvent` | `` `${string}.session-id` `` | `{ sessionId: string }` | a harness adapter, once when its in-sandbox session is created or resumed |
| `CodeModeExecutionStartedEvent` | `code_mode:execution_started` | `{ timestamp: number; codeLength: number }` | [Code Mode](../code-mode/code-mode), when sandbox execution begins |
| `CodeModeConsoleEvent` | `code_mode:console` | `{ level: 'log' \| 'warn' \| 'error' \| 'info'; message: string; timestamp: number }` | Code Mode, per `console.*` call inside the sandbox |
| `CodeModeExternalCallEvent` | `code_mode:external_call` | `{ function: string; args: unknown; timestamp: number }` | Code Mode, before a bound `external_*` function runs |
| `CodeModeExternalResultEvent` | `code_mode:external_result` | `{ function: string; result: unknown; duration: number }` | Code Mode, after a successful `external_*` call |
| `CodeModeExternalErrorEvent` | `code_mode:external_error` | `{ function: string; error: string; duration: number }` | Code Mode, when an `external_*` call throws |
| `CodeModeSnippetCallEvent` | `code_mode:snippet_call` | `{ snippet: string; input: unknown; timestamp: number }` | [Code Mode with Snippets](../code-mode/code-mode-with-snippets), before a snippet runs |
| `CodeModeSnippetResultEvent` | `code_mode:snippet_result` | `{ snippet: string; result: unknown; duration: number; timestamp: number }` | Code Mode with Snippets, after a successful snippet run |
| `CodeModeSnippetErrorEvent` | `code_mode:snippet_error` | `{ snippet: string; error: string; duration: number; timestamp: number }` | Code Mode with Snippets, when a snippet throws |
| `SnippetRegisteredEvent` | `snippet:registered` | `{ id: string; name: string; description: string; timestamp: number }` | when a snippet is registered into the tool registry |
| `StructuredOutputStartEvent` | `structured-output.start` | `{ messageId: string }` | [`chat({ outputSchema, stream: true })`](../structured-outputs/streaming), once per structured message |
| `StructuredOutputCompleteEvent<T>` | `structured-output.complete` | `{ object: T; raw: string; reasoning?: string }` | structured-output streaming, once with the validated object |
| `ApprovalRequestedEvent` | `approval-requested` | `{ toolCallId: string; toolName: string; input: unknown; approval: { id: string; needsApproval: true } }` | a server tool needs approval — the run pauses; see [Tool Approval Flow](../tools/tool-approval) |
| `ToolInputAvailableEvent` | `tool-input-available` | `{ toolCallId: string; toolName: string; input: unknown }` | a client tool is invoked — the run pauses; see [Client Tools](../tools/client-tools) |
| `UIResourceEvent` | `ui-resource` | `{ resource; serverId?: string; toolCallId: string; toolName: string; meta?: Record<string, unknown> }` | an MCP tool returns a `ui://` resource ([MCP Apps](../mcp/apps)) |

## These stay CUSTOM

Harness `*.session-id` events and `structured-output.start` / `structured-output.complete` stay `CUSTOM`. They are not fields on `RUN_FINISHED`.

Read them with the same `chunk.type === "CUSTOM" && chunk.name === "..."` branch as the rest of this page. See [Streaming structured output](../structured-outputs/streaming) for the complete event.

## Your own custom events aren't in this union

Tools and chat middleware can emit application-defined events through
`emitCustomEvent`.

A server tool receives `emitCustomEvent` on its execution context:

```ts
import { toolDefinition } from "@tanstack/ai";
import { z } from "zod";

const importRows = toolDefinition({
  name: "importRows",
  description: "Import rows into the dataset, reporting progress as it runs",
  inputSchema: z.object({ rows: z.array(z.string()) }),
}).server(async ({ rows }, context) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < rows.length; i++) {
    context?.emitCustomEvent("my-app:progress", {
      done: i + 1,
      total: rows.length,
    });
  }
  return { imported: rows.length };
});
```

Chat middleware calls the same helper on `ChatMiddlewareContext`. The engine
yields the chunk while the hook is still running, so a long `onConfig` can
send `started` before the work finishes:

```ts
import { type ChatMiddleware } from "@tanstack/ai";

async function prepare() {
  await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, 1);
  });
}

const progress: ChatMiddleware = {
  name: "progress",
  async onConfig(ctx) {
    if (ctx.phase !== "beforeModel") return;
    ctx.emitCustomEvent("my-app:progress", { step: "prepare" });
    await prepare();
    ctx.emitCustomEvent("my-app:progress", { step: "ready" });
  },
};
```

With durability on the response, each of these events flushes as soon as it
is emitted, so `prepare` reaches the client while `prepare()` is still
running. High-volume names stay in the durability batch:
`process.stdout`, `process.stderr`, `sandbox.file`, and `sandbox.file.diff`.
Pass `{ batch: true }` to keep one of your own events in that batch:

```ts
import { type ChatMiddleware } from "@tanstack/ai";

const noisy: ChatMiddleware = {
  name: "noisy",
  async onConfig(ctx) {
    ctx.emitCustomEvent("my-app:ticks", { n: 1 }, { batch: true });
  },
};
```

These flow over the wire exactly like the built-in events: same `CUSTOM`
chunk shape, same runtime behavior. But `'my-app:progress'` isn't one of the
literal names in `KnownCustomEvent`, so it's intentionally absent from
`ChatStream`'s type. This is the same tradeoff `StructuredOutputStream`
already made: including a generic fallback member would reintroduce the
`value: any` poison for every other event on the stream.

To read your own event's `value`, don't rely on `ChatStream`'s narrowed
union for that branch — annotate the stream as the wider `StreamChunk` type
instead, where the generic `CUSTOM` member's `value: any` needs no cast:

```ts ignore
import { chat } from "@tanstack/ai";
import { openaiText } from "@tanstack/ai-openai";
import type { StreamChunk } from "@tanstack/ai";
import { importRows } from "./tools";

const stream: AsyncIterable<StreamChunk> = chat({
  adapter: openaiText("gpt-5.5"),
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Import these rows" }],
  tools: [importRows],
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  if (chunk.type === "CUSTOM" && chunk.name === "my-app:progress") {
    console.log(chunk.value.done, chunk.value.total); // value: any — your event, your shape
  }
}
```

The event still arrives at runtime either way — this only changes what
TypeScript will let you write. `ChatStream` is the right default for reading
TanStack AI's own events with full type safety; fall back to `StreamChunk`
for the branches that read your own.
