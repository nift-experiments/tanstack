SSE and NDJSON open one connection per turn. A WebSocket is different: one
socket stays open for the whole conversation, carries every turn, and lets the
server push chunks without waiting on a request. Reach for it when you want a
persistent channel instead of a request-per-message model: a WebSocket
gateway you already run, a mobile client that wants to avoid repeated
handshakes, or a UI that needs the server to push outside of a reply (this page
only covers the request/reply case; server-initiated pushes need your own
framing on top).

By the end of this page you can run a chat turn over a socket that resumes
after a drop, without re-running the model.

## The shape of it

One socket, many turns:

1. The client opens the socket once.
2. Each user message becomes one JSON frame sent over the socket (the same
   shape as the SSE/NDJSON POST body).
3. The server runs one `chat()` turn per frame and streams the chunks back
   over the same socket.
4. The socket stays open after `RUN_FINISHED` (waiting for the next frame)
   until the client closes it, an idle timeout fires, or the process aborts.

## Server: `onRun`

Pair the socket you already accepted with `toWebSocketStream`. It decodes
inbound frames, starts one `chat()` turn per frame through `onRun`, and pumps
the resulting chunks back out:

```ts
import { chat, memoryStream, toWebSocketStream } from '@tanstack/ai'
import { openaiText } from '@tanstack/ai-openai'
import type { WebSocketLike } from '@tanstack/ai'

// Bridge the per-turn AbortSignal WsRunContext hands you into the
// AbortController chat() expects.
function abortControllerFromSignal(signal: AbortSignal): AbortController {
  const controller = new AbortController()
  if (signal.aborted) controller.abort(signal.reason)
  else
    signal.addEventListener('abort', () => controller.abort(signal.reason), {
      once: true,
    })
  return controller
}

// `socket` is a WHATWG-shaped server socket you already accepted (see
// "Hosting" below for where it comes from on Node vs Cloudflare) and
// `request` is the original handshake request.
export function handleChatSocket(socket: WebSocketLike, request: Request) {
  toWebSocketStream(socket, request, {
    // Per-turn durability, keyed by the frame's runId (see "Durability is
    // per turn" below).
    durability: (ctx) => memoryStream(ctx.request),
    onRun: ({ messages, threadId, runId, signal }) =>
      chat({
        adapter: openaiText('gpt-5.5'),
        messages,
        threadId,
        runId,
        abortController: abortControllerFromSignal(signal),
      }),
  })
}
```

`onRun` receives one `WsRunContext` per inbound frame:

| Field | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `messages` | The turn's `UIMessage[]` / `ModelMessage[]`, decoded from the frame. |
| `threadId` / `runId` | The AG-UI identifiers for this turn. |
| `forwardedProps` | Any extra data the client sent with the frame. |
| `request` | A synthetic per-turn `Request` carrying `?runId=` in its URL, for keying a durability adapter. |
| `signal` | Aborts when the socket closes, or when this turn receives an `abort` frame (see below). It does not abort other turns on the same socket. |

Skip `durability` entirely for a socket that doesn't need to survive a drop.
`toWebSocketStream` still pumps chunks, it just can't replay them on
reconnect.

## Client: `webSocket()`

`webSocket()` is a `SubscribeConnectionAdapter` for `useChat` (also exported
from `@tanstack/ai-solid`, `@tanstack/ai-vue`, `@tanstack/ai-svelte`, and
`@tanstack/ai-angular`). It opens the socket lazily on the first
`sendMessage`, and reuses it for every later turn in the conversation:

```tsx
import { useChat, webSocket } from '@tanstack/ai-react'

const connection = webSocket('/api/chat-ws')

export function Chat() {
  const { messages, sendMessage } = useChat({ connection })

  return <button onClick={() => void sendMessage('Hello')}>Send</button>
}
```

Nothing else changes: `messages`, `sendMessage`, `stop()`, tool calls, and
persistence all work the same as with any other connection adapter. Options:

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `protocols` | WebSocket subprotocol(s), passed straight to the `WebSocket` constructor. |
| `body` | Static extra fields merged into every outgoing `RunAgentInput` frame (same as the HTTP adapters' `body`). |
| `reconnect` | Reconnect bounds (`maxAttempts`, `delayMs`), shared semantics with `fetchServerSentEvents` — see [Advanced](./advanced). |
| `WebSocketImpl` | Override the `WebSocket` implementation (tests, non-browser runtimes). |

See [Transports](../transports/overview) for where `webSocket()`
fits among the other adapters.

## Wire protocol

| Direction | Frame | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client → server | A `RunAgentInput`-shaped JSON object (same shape as the SSE/NDJSON POST body) | Start one `chat()` turn. |
| Client → server | `{ "type": "abort", "runId": "…" }` | Abort one in-flight turn (see below). |
| Server → client | `{ "id": "…", "chunk": <StreamChunk> }` | One chunk, tagged with a durability offset (only when `durability` is configured). |
| Server → client | A bare `StreamChunk` | One chunk, untagged (no `durability` configured). |
| Server → client | `{ "type": "ping" }` | Heartbeat. `webSocket()` drops these automatically; a hand-rolled client should ignore anything with `type: "ping"`. |

The two server→client shapes are unambiguous: the envelope never has a
top-level `type`, and every bare `StreamChunk` does.

## Resume rides in the URL, not a header

SSE and NDJSON resume with the `Last-Event-ID` header, because a `fetch`/XHR
request can set arbitrary headers before it opens. A browser's `WebSocket`
constructor cannot set custom headers on the handshake, so the offset instead
rides in the URL: `?runId=<id>&offset=<lastId>`.

`webSocket()` handles this for you. If the socket drops before a run's
terminal chunk (`RUN_FINISHED` / `RUN_ERROR`) and that run was durable
(offset-tagged envelopes), it reopens at `?runId=&offset=` and de-dupes the
replayed boundary, the same reconnect guarantee `fetchServerSentEvents` gives
you, just carried differently on the wire. A run that never emitted an offset
(no `durability` configured) has nothing to resume from: the drop surfaces as
a connection error instead of retrying forever.

On the server, a URL carrying `?offset=` is a resume, not a fresh turn. Route
it to `resumeWebSocketStream`, a read-only replay of the durability log with
no model call:

```ts
import { memoryStream, resumeWebSocketStream } from '@tanstack/ai'
import type { WebSocketLike } from '@tanstack/ai'

export function handleResumeSocket(socket: WebSocketLike, request: Request) {
  resumeWebSocketStream(socket, { adapter: memoryStream(request) })
}
```

`resumeWebSocketStream` closes the socket with code `1008` if the request
carries no resume offset: there's nothing to replay.

## Durability is per turn

A conversation-scoped socket carries many turns, so its durability adapter
can't be built once for the whole connection. Each turn needs its own log,
keyed by that turn's `runId`. That's why `durability` in `toWebSocketStream`
is a factory, not a value: it receives the per-turn `ctx` and reads
`ctx.request`, whose URL already carries that turn's `?runId=`
(`memoryStream`/`durableStream` key off it automatically).

## Abort a turn

An `{ type: 'abort', runId }` frame aborts only that turn's `onRun` iteration
(`ctx.signal` fires); the socket itself stays open for the next turn. The
built-in `webSocket()` client adapter sends this frame when the run's abort
signal fires (`stop()` in `useChat`), so the server actually stops generating
instead of running the model call to completion against a client that stopped
listening. A hand-rolled client should send the same frame to cancel a turn.

Closing the whole socket aborts every turn still in flight on it.

## Heartbeat and idle timeout

`toWebSocketStream` sends a `{ type: 'ping' }` frame every `heartbeatMs`
(default 30 seconds) to keep the connection alive through proxies that drop
idle sockets. It closes the socket if no inbound frame arrives for
`idleTimeoutMs` (default 5 minutes); a heartbeat itself doesn't count as
activity, only a client-sent frame does. The idle timeout never fires while a
turn is still streaming, so a long single generation (an agentic loop, a
turn longer than the timeout) is never cut off:

```ts
import { chat, toWebSocketStream } from '@tanstack/ai'
import { openaiText } from '@tanstack/ai-openai'
import type { WebSocketLike } from '@tanstack/ai'

function handleChatSocket(socket: WebSocketLike, request: Request) {
  toWebSocketStream(socket, request, {
    onRun: ({ messages, threadId, runId }) =>
      chat({ adapter: openaiText('gpt-5.5'), messages, threadId, runId }),
    heartbeatMs: 15_000,
    idleTimeoutMs: 60_000,
  })
}
```

## Hosting on Node

Plain Node (and anywhere else without a global `WebSocketPair`) has no
built-in way to accept a WebSocket upgrade, so you do it yourself and hand the
result to `toWebSocketStream`. The pattern: hook the HTTP server's `upgrade`
event, accept the socket with [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws)'s
`WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })`, and pass the resulting socket straight
through. `ws`'s socket already implements the `send`/`close`/
`addEventListener` surface `WebSocketLike` needs:

```ts ignore
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws'
import { memoryStream, resumeWebSocketStream } from '@tanstack/ai'
import type { Plugin } from 'vite'
import { handleChatSocket } from './handle-chat-socket'

const WS_PATH = '/api/chat-ws'

export function webSocketChatPlugin(): Plugin {
  return {
    name: 'websocket-chat-plugin',
    configureServer(server) {
      if (!server.httpServer) return
      const wss = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })

      server.httpServer.on('upgrade', (req, socket, head) => {
        const url = new URL(req.url ?? '/', `http://${req.headers.host}`)
        if (url.pathname !== WS_PATH) return

        wss.handleUpgrade(req, socket, head, (ws) => {
          // `ws`'s socket satisfies WebSocketLike structurally — pass it
          // straight through, no adapter needed.
          const request = new Request(url)
          if (url.searchParams.get('offset') !== null) {
            resumeWebSocketStream(ws, { adapter: memoryStream(request) })
          } else {
            handleChatSocket(ws, request)
          }
        })
      })
    },
  }
}
```

This is the same pattern used by the working
[`examples/ts-react-chat`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/blob/main/examples/ts-react-chat/src/lib/websocket-chat-plugin.ts)
WebSocket example and by the e2e suite's
[`durable-delivery-ws-plugin.ts`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/blob/main/testing/e2e/src/lib/durable-delivery-ws-plugin.ts).
The same wiring pattern applies elsewhere: accept the platform's socket, then
call `toWebSocketStream` / `resumeWebSocketStream` with it. A socket from
Deno's `Deno.upgradeWebSocket` is WHATWG-shaped and satisfies `WebSocketLike`
directly; Bun's `ServerWebSocket` (handler-object API) needs a small adapter
first.

## Hosting on Cloudflare

Cloudflare Workers (and Durable Objects) expose a global `WebSocketPair`, so
you don't upgrade anything by hand. `toWebSocketResponse` creates the pair,
accepts the server half, wires it to `toWebSocketStream`, and returns the 101
upgrade `Response` for you:

```ts
import { chat, toWebSocketResponse } from '@tanstack/ai'
import { openaiText } from '@tanstack/ai-openai'

export default {
  fetch(request: Request): Response {
    return toWebSocketResponse(request, {
      onRun: ({ messages, threadId, runId }) =>
        chat({ adapter: openaiText('gpt-5.5'), messages, threadId, runId }),
    })
  },
}
```

`resumeWebSocketResponse({ adapter })` is the matching read-only wrapper for a
`?offset=` resume. Both throw with a message pointing at their `*Stream`
counterpart if called somewhere without `WebSocketPair` (Node, for instance),
so there's no way to accidentally ship the Cloudflare wrapper to a runtime
that can't upgrade a socket itself.

## Producer vs. socket lifecycle

The same caveat that applies to SSE and NDJSON applies here: with
`memoryStream`, the run's producer and the delivery socket live in the same
process. If that socket drops, the `chat()` call backing it aborts too, so
reconnecting only replays what was already logged rather than resuming a run
still in progress. `durableStream` decouples the two (the producer runs
against a backend, not the client's socket), so a drop there can reconnect to
a run that's still actively producing. See
[memoryStream in production](./advanced#memorystream-in-production) for the
full explanation. It applies to WebSockets exactly as written there.
