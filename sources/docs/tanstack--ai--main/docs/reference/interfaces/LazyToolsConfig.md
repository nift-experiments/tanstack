Configuration for the lazy-tool discovery catalog, shared by chat() and
Code Mode. Optional in both — lazy behavior is triggered purely by tools
marked `lazy: true`; this only tunes how much of each lazy tool's
description appears in the pre-discovery catalog. The post-discovery payload
always returns the full description + schema.

## Properties

### includeDescription?

```ts
optional includeDescription?: "full" | "first-sentence" | "none";
```

catalog (the names list shown before the model discovers the tool).

#### Default

'none'
```
