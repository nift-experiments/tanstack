Defined in: [packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts:83](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/blob/main/packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts#L83)

A [StreamDurability](StreamDurability.md) that can re-persist an already-stored range
idempotently.

A run driver resuming after a crash re-derives the same offsets from its
source position, so replaying an overlapping range must be a no-op rather
than producing duplicates. That capability is deliberately a **separate,
optional method** instead of an optional parameter on `append`:

- Only adapters that actually support it return this type, so a consumer
  requiring the capability asks for `UpsertableStreamDurability` and a
  mismatch is a compile error rather than a runtime failure buried in a
  run log.
- Pairing each chunk with its offset structurally makes a length mismatch
  and an unpaired chunk unrepresentable. A sparse hole is still
  representable, so implementations must reject one explicitly.

Implementations MUST validate the entire batch before mutating any stored
state (so a rejected call never partially applies), MUST reject an offset
they did not mint themselves (every accepted offset is resumable by
definition), MUST reject an offset repeated within one batch, and MUST
reject a hole in the entries array.

## Extends

- [`StreamDurability`](StreamDurability.md)\<`TOffset`\>

## Type Parameters

### TOffset

`TOffset` *extends* `string` = `string`

## Properties

### append

```ts
append: (chunks) => Promise<TOffset[]>;
```

Defined in: [packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts:17](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/blob/main/packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts#L17)

Persist a batch before it is delivered and return exactly one resumable
offset for each chunk, in the same order.

#### Parameters

##### chunks

[`AGUIEvent`](../type-aliases/AGUIEvent.md)[]

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`TOffset`[]\>

#### Inherited from

[`StreamDurability`](StreamDurability.md).[`append`](StreamDurability.md#append)

***

### close

```ts
close: () => Promise<void>;
```

Defined in: [packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts:27](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/blob/main/packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts#L27)

Terminalize the producer log and unblock live readers. Core awaits this
for every producer exit, including completion, cancellation, and failure.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>

#### Inherited from

[`StreamDurability`](StreamDurability.md).[`close`](StreamDurability.md#close)

***

### read

```ts
read: (offset, signal?) => AsyncIterable<{
  chunk: AGUIEvent;
  offset: TOffset;
}>;
```

Defined in: [packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts:19](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/blob/main/packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts#L19)

Replay chunks strictly after the supplied adapter-owned offset.

#### Parameters

##### offset

`TOffset`

##### signal?

`AbortSignal`

#### Returns

`AsyncIterable`\<\{
  `chunk`: [`AGUIEvent`](../type-aliases/AGUIEvent.md);
  `offset`: `TOffset`;
\}\>

#### Inherited from

[`StreamDurability`](StreamDurability.md).[`read`](StreamDurability.md#read)

***

### resumeFrom

```ts
resumeFrom: () => TOffset | null;
```

Defined in: [packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts:12](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/blob/main/packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts#L12)

Return the adapter offset captured from the request, or null for a producer.

#### Returns

`TOffset` \| `null`

#### Inherited from

[`StreamDurability`](StreamDurability.md).[`resumeFrom`](StreamDurability.md#resumefrom)

***

### snapshot

```ts
snapshot: () => Promise<object[]>;
```

Defined in: [packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts:57](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/blob/main/packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts#L57)

Everything stored for this run **at the moment of the call**, in append
order, then resolve.

This is the bounded counterpart to [StreamDurability.read](StreamDurability.md#read). `read`
tails: it parks until the log is terminalized or the caller aborts, so it
cannot be used to inspect a log whose producer died without calling
`close` — that log stays open forever and a `for await` over it never
finishes. `snapshot` exists for exactly that case: a producer resuming a
run needs to see the prefix a previous host already stored so it can line
its own output up against it, and it needs that read to *return*.

Implementations MUST:

- never wait for more entries — resolve with what is stored, including
  while the log is still open and still being appended to;
- resolve to an empty array for a run with nothing stored, rather than
  throwing. In particular an implementation must not reuse the
  unknown-run failure path a from-start `read` join takes (`read('-1')` on
  an empty log is allowed to fail; `snapshot()` is not). A backend over a
  network may of course still reject on a transport, protocol, or
  authorization failure — that is a failed call, not an empty run;
- return a fresh array the caller can keep or mutate without reaching the
  stored log through it.

The result is a point-in-time view and carries no lock: a concurrent
`append` may land immediately after the snapshot is taken, so a caller
must not treat the last returned offset as the permanent tail.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`object`[]\>

#### Inherited from

[`StreamDurability`](StreamDurability.md).[`snapshot`](StreamDurability.md#snapshot)

### upsert

```ts
upsert: (entries) => Promise<TOffset[]>;
```

Defined in: [packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts:90](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/blob/main/packages/ai/src/stream-durability.ts#L90)

Persist a batch at caller-supplied offsets, replacing any entry already
stored at the same offset. Returns the offsets in the order supplied.

#### Parameters

##### entries

`object`[]

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`TOffset`[]\>
