Convention for tool-call `metadata` that marks a call as **provider-executed**
— run by the provider's own infrastructure (e.g. Anthropic `web_search` /
`web_fetch` server tools) rather than by the agent loop. Adapters set
`providerExecuted: true` so that:

1. The agent loop never tries to execute the call client-side (see
   [isProviderExecutedToolCall](../functions/isProviderExecutedToolCall.md) usage in the chat engine), and
2. The adapter can stash the raw provider result alongside it so the call —
   and its evidence — round-trips into the next turn's request.

Provider-specific payloads live under a namespaced key (e.g. `anthropic`),
keeping this convention opaque to the framework core. The index signature
preserves those per-adapter fields. `sources` is the normalized list of
links a web search used, shared across providers.
