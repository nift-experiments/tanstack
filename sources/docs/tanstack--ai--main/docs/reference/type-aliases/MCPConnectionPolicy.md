Defined in: [packages/ai/src/activities/chat/mcp/types.ts:50](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/blob/main/packages/ai/src/activities/chat/mcp/types.ts#L50)

Controls what happens to MCP connections when the chat run ends.

- `'close'` (default) — `chat()` closes each connection when the run ends
  (after the agent loop completes and the stream is drained), so tools can
  still execute throughout the run.
- `'keep-alive'` — `chat()` never closes the connections; the caller owns
  their lifecycle (e.g. keep them warm across requests).
