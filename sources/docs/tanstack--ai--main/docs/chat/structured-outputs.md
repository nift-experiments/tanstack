The structured-outputs guide has moved to its own top-level section, split by what you're building. Pick the journey that fits:

- **[Overview](../structured-outputs/overview)** — what structured output is, schema library options, provider support, and "which page do I read?"
- **[One-Shot Extraction](../structured-outputs/one-shot)** — single prompt in, single typed object out. Use this when you don't need streaming or chat history.
- **[Streaming UIs](../structured-outputs/streaming)** — `useChat({ outputSchema })` with `partial` and `final` populating a UI field by field.
- **[Multi-Turn Chat](../structured-outputs/multi-turn)** — each successfully completed structured-output run adds a typed response to message history, and `messages[i].parts.find(p => p.type === "structured-output").data` is typed by your schema.
- **[With Tools](../structured-outputs/with-tools)** — combining `outputSchema` with the agent loop, including pause/resume for server-tool approvals and client-tool invocations.
- **[Harness Agents](../structured-outputs/harnesses)** — a coding agent in a sandbox inspects files, then returns a typed object.
