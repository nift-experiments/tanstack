`intent maintainer` provides one command workflow for creating, maintaining, and distributing library skills. Skills stay in their owning packages. The commands keep registrations and generated metadata consistent; maintainers and coding agents supply the task knowledge and review conclusions.

`intent maintainer --help` lists the actions in the order a maintainer runs them, each with a one-line summary and a `Writes:` line naming the files it changes. `intent maintainer <action> --help` prints only that action's usage and options.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `maintainer setup` | Register existing package skills, create missing planning records, and install repository guidance and CI. |
| `maintainer add <name>` | Create a skill skeleton or register an existing skill in the cumulative record. |
| `maintainer remove <name>` | Retire a registered skill in the planning records without deleting its guidance. |
| `maintainer status` | Show authoring gaps, stale generated files, and pending source reviews. |
| `maintainer sync` | Align tree metadata, package publishing entries, plugin manifests, and consumer install commands. |
| `maintainer review` | Inspect Git changes and record review outcomes interactively or from an annotated JSON report. |
| `maintainer check` | Check skill structure, registration, generated metadata, and recorded reviews locally or in CI. |

The former `scaffold` command is removed. Use `maintainer setup` and `maintainer add` for file creation, and `meta generate-skill` for the authoring procedure.

## Setup

Run from a Git working tree containing the library's package manifest:

<!-- ::start:tabs variant="package-manager" mode="local-install" -->

@tanstack/intent@latest maintainer setup

<!-- ::end:tabs -->

Setup preserves existing documents and repository instructions and copies the [CI workflow](./intent-setup) when it is missing. Standalone packages use `skills/_artifacts/`; monorepos share `_artifacts/` at the repository root. An existing custom location is retained. If several locations exist, select one with `--artifacts <repository-relative-directory>`.

The three records have separate jobs:

| Record | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `domain_map.yaml` | Domains, developer tasks, supported failure modes, and knowledge gaps. |
| `skill_spec.md` | Coverage, maintainer decisions, check results, and batch history. |
| `skill_tree.yaml` | Skill identities, owning packages, paths, source mappings, prerequisites, and the distribution choice. |

Generated skeletons remain unfinished. Author their contents and remove the `intent:needs-authoring` marker after completing that work. A successful setup command does not mean the skills are ready to publish.

Setup automatically registers valid, Git-visible `skills/**/SKILL.md` files in the root package and workspace packages, preserving their content. It skips dependencies, hidden agent directories, and paths that [`review.ignore`](./intent-review#ignored-paths) matches. It also skips invalid skills and conflicting names, and reports each one. Domains come from `metadata.domain`, the existing domain map, a parent directory under `skills/`, or `uncategorized`; review that placeholder and complete task coverage. For custom locations outside `skills/`, use `maintainer add --path`. Repeating setup preserves existing registrations and workflow files. Reviewers can use [interactive review](./intent-review#interactive-review) in a human terminal; CI uses the noninteractive checks.

## Add a skill

<!-- ::start:tabs variant="package-manager" mode="local-install" -->

@tanstack/intent@latest maintainer add retries --package packages/client --domain requests --description "Use when configuring retries with this client." --source "src/retry.ts"

<!-- ::end:tabs -->

`--package` is repository-relative. When you omit it, the command registers the skill with the workspace member that owns the current directory; run it from the repository root, or pass `--package`, for a standalone package or a repository-owned discovery skill. The default path is `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` within that package. Use `--path <package-relative-path>/SKILL.md` for an established layout. Repeat `--source` and `--requires` to supply multiple paths or prerequisites.

Repeat `--task <text>` to record the developer tasks the skill covers in `domain_map.yaml` at registration. Without it, `maintainer status` and `maintainer check` report that the domain map still needs those tasks until you add them.

To register existing guidance, supply its name, domain, package, and path. The command reads its frontmatter and preserves the file. To change an already registered skill, edit its guidance and run `maintainer sync`.

A tree entry's `path` is relative to its `package`. When a hand-written entry repeats the package directory in `path`, such as `package: packages/client` with `path: packages/client/skills/query/SKILL.md`, `maintainer status` lists `skill_tree.yaml` as a file to synchronize and `maintainer sync` rewrites the path as `skills/query/SKILL.md`.

Registration updates the tree and domain map and appends an entry to the spec. The command prints every file it wrote. Write the task coverage, source-backed guidance, and consequential decisions; the command does not infer them.

## Remove a skill

<!-- ::start:tabs variant="package-manager" mode="local-install" -->

@tanstack/intent@latest maintainer remove retries

<!-- ::end:tabs -->

Removal retires the skill: its tree entry gets `status: retired` and `skill_spec.md` gains a note to record why the guidance is no longer needed. The command never deletes `SKILL.md`. It prints the path so you can delete the file once its guidance is no longer needed, then run `maintainer sync` and `maintainer review`.

The command refuses while the skill is selected for repository distribution or required by another active skill, and names what to change first. Reselect the remaining skills with `maintainer setup --distribution repo --skill <name>`, or update the dependent skill's prerequisites, then retry.

A skill name is unique within its owning package, so two workspace packages can register the same name. A prerequisite name refers to a skill in the same package. When more than one package registers the name, the command lists those packages; pass `--package <directory>` to select the skill to retire. A name that more than one package registers cannot be selected for repository distribution.

## Choose repository distribution

Package skills can also be offered through GitHub installers and native plugins. Select the registered skills explicitly:

<!-- ::start:tabs variant="package-manager" mode="local-install" -->

@tanstack/intent@latest maintainer setup --distribution repo --repository owner/library --skill discover-library --skill retries

<!-- ::end:tabs -->

The repository is inferred from package metadata when available. `--plugin-name <name>` can choose the initial plugin name. New skills are never added to the selection automatically, and local prerequisites must be selected explicitly.

Each `--skill` must name a registered tree entry whose `SKILL.md` exists; `planned` and `retired` entries are rejected. On a brand-new library, register and author the skills first, then run this command. Until then, record `--distribution none` or leave the choice unrecorded. When the repository, plugin name, or skill selection cannot be resolved, the command reports every missing input in one error.

To keep the package distribution workflow without generating repository exports:

<!-- ::start:tabs variant="package-manager" mode="local-install" -->

@tanstack/intent@latest maintainer setup --distribution none

<!-- ::end:tabs -->

Setup remembers this choice. Package-only distribution is the default, so an unrecorded choice does not block `maintainer check`. Select repository exports only when you want that additional installation route.

After authoring, `maintainer sync` updates Claude and Cursor plugin manifests and marketplace entries that point to the existing skill directories. It preserves unrelated plugin fields and other marketplace entries. It writes `.intent/skill-distribution.json` with source paths and install arguments, and prints commands consumers can copy. Sync refuses to generate exports while a selected skill still carries the `intent:needs-authoring` marker. Conflicting plugin identities or source roots require resolution before synchronization writes anything.

An existing Claude marketplace entry with `strict: false` conflicts with the generated component manifest. Sync rejects it before writing. Keep the existing policy until the maintainer decides to use `strict: true` or omit the field.

Opting out after exports exist clears the selected paths and Intent's marketplace entry on the next sync. Other plugin features and source skills remain. This does not revoke installed copies or hide public GitHub files.

### Consumer choices

- Use the generated `npx skills add owner/library --full-depth --skill <names>` command for a selected set, or `gh skill add owner/library <exact-SKILL.md-path>` for an individual skill. Full-depth discovery finds package skills even when the repository has root or agent-directory skills; the named selection still limits what is installed.
- Install the generated marketplace through Claude Code or Cursor's native plugin flow.
- Install the npm package and use Intent's existing `list`, `install`, and `load` commands for its bundled version of the guidance.

Repository location and installation scope are separate choices. The skill installers default to project scope; consumers can explicitly choose user scope with `--global` for `skills` or `--scope user` for `gh`. Third-party tools retain their own discovery behavior: a full scan or `--all` may expose other public skills. Use the generated selection or exact paths for a curated subset.

A discovery skill can help someone decide whether a library fits before they install it. Keep that guidance about supported tasks and setup choices, respect the project's chosen stack, and hand API implementation to the installed package's skills and source. Avoid maintaining another copy of version-sensitive API instructions in the discovery skill.

### Releases and updates

Generated commands do not pin a revision or match the application's installed dependency versions. Each installer resolves its own default source. For a specific release, add `--pin <tag-or-sha>` to the generated GitHub command, use `https://github.com/owner/library/tree/<ref>` as the `skills add` source, or add a Claude marketplace from `owner/library@<tag>`. Verify that the selected paths exist at that revision.

Intent preserves existing plugin version fields. Claude uses an explicit plugin version to decide whether an update is available: bump the authoritative plugin version when releasing changed content. Without a version in either the plugin or its marketplace entry, Git-based Claude installs use the source commit. Updating an npm package version alone does not update plugin metadata.

Publish through the library's normal release process. Repository exports do not submit marketplace listings, publish releases, or update consumer installations. State the supported package versions in implementation skills and check them against the consumer's dependencies. Consumers manage updates and removal through their chosen installer.

## Maintain and check

<!-- ::start:tabs variant="package-manager" mode="local-install" -->

@tanstack/intent@latest maintainer status
@tanstack/intent@latest maintainer sync
@tanstack/intent@latest maintainer review --interactive

<!-- ::end:tabs -->

Status accepts `--json` and an actual Git comparison base with `--base <ref>`. Sync copies descriptions, purpose, sources, and prerequisites from the registered skills into the tree. It also adds the package discovery keyword and includes each skill directory in existing `files` allowlists. An absent allowlist stays absent, preserving npm's default contents. Sync prints each path it synchronized, or `Nothing to synchronize.` when every file is current, and labels the consumer install commands when repository distribution is selected. Inspect the actual packed archive in the library's release checks.

`maintainer review --interactive` is the human path. It walks each pending item in the terminal, shows the current guidance and changed files, and records the chosen outcomes with reason and evidence. It requires a terminal outside CI.

After checking every pending item, agents and scripts can record one shared conclusion with `maintainer review --unchanged "<reason>"` or `maintainer review --updated "<reason>"`. Use the [one-command review](./intent-review#record-all-pending-items) only when that conclusion covers every item. Use the JSON path for different outcomes or evidence per item. Generate the report and save it under `.intent/`, which `maintainer setup` created:

<!-- ::start:tabs variant="package-manager" mode="local-install" -->

```text
@tanstack/intent@latest maintainer review --json > .intent/review.json
```

<!-- ::end:tabs -->

Annotate the completed items, then record the report and run the combined check:

<!-- ::start:tabs variant="package-manager" mode="local-install" -->

@tanstack/intent@latest maintainer review --record .intent/review.json
@tanstack/intent@latest maintainer check

<!-- ::end:tabs -->

The report's `recording` block lists the allowed outcomes, the narrower planning outcomes, the required fields, and the record command. `--record` rejects a report that annotates none of its items. The [source-review reference](./intent-review) describes the report format, fingerprints, baseline recovery, and the [Intent-owned paths](./intent-review#ignored-paths) that unmapped-change review skips by default. `maintainer review` supports its `--base`, `--json`, `--record`, `--interactive`, `--unchanged`, and `--updated` options. The standalone `review` command also remains available for workflow reminder output and review-only checks.

`maintainer check --base <pull-request-base>` runs the same maintainer checks in CI. It validates the workspace's default skill directories together with custom registered roots in one run, including code examples and relative links. Add `--github-summary` to write the headline, authoring issues, files to sync, and pending review items to the GitHub Actions step summary after the validation section; the generated workflow passes it. The flag belongs to `check` alone. It does not publish, install consumer skills, or certify that an agent's recorded conclusion is correct. Missing task evidence remains a review responsibility. Repository validation protects the source tree; it does not execute an authoring model in CI.

## Verify distribution

Before releasing a library's exports, install the selected skills in disposable consumer projects through every advertised route. Check the installed names, bundled references and scripts, supported package versions, update behavior, and removal. Opting out in the source repository must not be described as removing consumer copies.

Use each host's native plugin flow, including [Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/plugins). Inspect all loaded components: the repository root becomes the plugin root, so preserved or automatically discovered commands, agents, hooks, and MCP configuration are not limited by the skill selection. Run a real consumer task; valid metadata does not establish correct guidance.

When changing Intent's distribution implementation, run the [contributor compatibility gate](https://github.com/TanStack/intent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#distribution-compatibility). That guide owns the required tools, verified versions, and automated checks.

Cursor acceptance and agent task quality remain separate checks. Record an unavailable host or missing task evidence as incomplete, even when the automated gate passes.
