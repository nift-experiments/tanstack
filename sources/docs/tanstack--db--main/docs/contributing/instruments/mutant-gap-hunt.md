# Mutant gap hunt

**Use when:** a recent refactor, a suspicious green oracle, or an open review
question leaves doubt that the tests would reject a plausible wrong behavior.
One carefully chosen mutant can answer a useful question; a campaign is optional.

**Inputs:** the changed code and commits that shaped it, the claimed law and its
authority, the primary oracle's contract prose and stated limits, its
coverage-map row, open review questions, and the public observation that could
distinguish a mistake. Keep test bodies and assertions out of the design brief.

## Operation

1. **Design plausible mistakes before reading the tests.** Start with semantic,
   type-plausible edits near the changed boundaries: a lost operand, wrong
   prior value, premature clear, duplicated event, changed ordering, or skipped
   callback. Turn each open review question into a candidate. If code is called
   dead, try removing it. In a larger hunt, spread candidates across the
   affected files and boundaries rather than clustering where edits are easy.
   Hand-write candidates at boundaries a designer may miss, such as receipt
   wrappers, lazy getters, and caches. If a separate designer is authorized,
   keep the current assertions out of its brief. Otherwise draft the candidates
   before inspecting those assertions and label the design as self-generated.
2. **Make each edit replayable.** Record `{ id, file, old, new, desc }`; require
   `old` to occur exactly once at the pinned revision and `new` to parse. Change
   one decision per mutant; a compound kill does not identify which part the
   comparison rejected. Run each candidate in an isolated checkout against an
   unchanged, pinned baseline, then restore the checkout exactly. Use `main`
   when measuring what the existing suite catches; use a PR revision when
   challenging its new coverage. Do not combine those kill claims. A full-suite
   kill can locate an existing witness, but a crash outside the comparison,
   timeout, setup error, or unreached edit is not a kill there. Record that
   distinction, not a mutation score. Re-run carried-over survivors when the
   baseline revision moves.
3. **Interrogate every survivor.** Find a legal public history and checkpoint
   where baseline and mutant predict different observations, or name the
   invariant that makes them equivalent. If the observations differ but the
   contract permits both, record a **permitted difference** with its contract
   source; it is no oracle gap. If that freedom seems undesirable, take the
   question to law discovery or adversarial review at the suitability level.
   Grade an equivalence claim at a named revision: equivalent by invariant,
   equivalent only on instrumented reached histories with a positive control,
   or evidence-limited and unresolved. The last is not an equivalence verdict.
   Check all relevant entry paths, including reentry and environment-specific
   branches; one unreachable path does not establish general equivalence. Probe
   the nearest unusual legal history before accepting an unreachability claim.
   Treat earlier guesses as hints. Assert the distinguishing premise, then run
   the same focused probe on both revisions. A confirming probe for a test gap
   passes on the unchanged baseline and fails on the mutant at the intended
   assertion. If the contract instead predicts the mutant's result, record
   baseline RED and mutant GREEN, then investigate a product bug rather than
   calling it a test gap. Remove any temporary in-repository probe and show
   clean git status in its checkout.
4. **Repair the oracle chain, when authorized.** Locate the missing law, model
   rule, history action, production path, recorder, or assertion. Extend the
   primary owner where it can express the distinction. Show that the extension
   rejects the motivating mutant and a nearby plausible wrong design without
   rejecting a legal alternative. For a bug on the baseline, demonstrate the
   production RED before its repair. Update the coverage map when the owner's
   reach or limits change. For a claimed oracle repair, follow
   [ORC-012](../oracle-tests.md#orc-012-review-evidence): at closeout,
   verdict-critical evidence outside the executable oracle belongs in a
   versioned review record tied to the exact reviewed head. This card also asks
   the record to name the executable revision of every campaign, witness, and
   review-fix run behind its claims.

**Return:** each chosen mutant's pinned revision, exact edit, observed run
outcome using [ORC-006's categories](../oracle-tests.md#orc-006-checker-calibration),
public distinction or scoped equivalence argument, and disposition: oracle gap,
product bug, permitted difference, equivalence at a stated grade, or unresolved.
Keep raw run logs and result tables task-local unless the task explicitly asks
to publish them; this does not replace ORC-012's review record when an oracle is
repaired. Permitted difference is a survivor disposition, not a seventh run
outcome.

**Control:** public observations such as Collection reads, events, transaction
states, or query results decide product claims. Check that the probe reaches
the path and premise it names. A green suite does not prove equivalence; a
surviving mutant does not automatically prove a gap. Use a positive control
when instrumentation reports that a branch was never reached. Recheck types
after a commit hook or other tool rewrites code.

**Distortion:** mutants chosen to satisfy existing tests, syntax failures
counted as semantic kills, private-state differences treated as product bugs,
an oracle extension that accepts the motivating mutant at the relevant cut, a
negative witness that accepts any failure, or equivalence checked in one build
mode while another mode can observe the change.

**Stop when:** each selected mutant has an executed distinction, a contract-cited
permitted difference, a revision-scoped equivalence argument, or an explicit
unresolved experiment. Do not infer broad coverage from a kill count.

The collection-state hunts that inspired this card used larger campaigns.
Their candidate counts and archival format are examples, not requirements.
