# DEC-03 window-overlap oracle review

Reviewed semantic head: `f42fbcf4a642bc936e91309241137325c6f034e3` (branch `codex/audit-dec-03`).
Base: `33a194941c8d51f8f98babb999fef2987dd6ff8b`.
Owner: `packages/db/tests/conformance/infinite-suite.ts`, instantiated by the
React, Vue, and Svelte receiving drivers.

## Decision and boundary

The maintainer chose this rule: after a failed preload overlaps a successful
page request, `hasNextPage` follows the latest committed page count. The failed
preload's error remains visible until explicit recovery. The earlier behavior
forced continuation to `false` on the later page success. The fix recomputes
continuation in the asynchronous page-success branch.

The bounded contract is finite ordered source rows × a page size of two × a
failed initial-window preload × a successful second-page window × a public
snapshot after each settlement. Four rows distinguish exact exhaustion; five
rows distinguish a remaining row. The two settlement orders distinguish a
failure followed by success from success followed by failure. Each history also
checks explicit recovery. The model derives visible rows, page boundaries,
params, continuation, status, and error from the source length, committed page
count, and the chosen error lifetime. It does not copy the controller's
`failedHasNextPage` cache.

The production driver calls the exported DB window controller in each package
realm. It uses a real ordered live-query Collection and controls the two
`setWindow` results with Promises. It checks the exact limits 3 and 5, then
compares public snapshots at 12 checkpoints per driver. Current framework
hooks expose `fetchNextPage` but no `preload`, so this test does not establish
the same overlap through a hook. Adjacent shared scenarios retain hook paging
coverage.

## RED, GREEN, and hostile controls

On unchanged production, the new shared cell failed in React, Vue, and Svelte
at the failure-first, five-row final checkpoint: expected `hasNextPage: true`,
received `false`. This was an assertion failure on the public snapshot. After
the one-branch production change, the DB controller suite passed 75/75 and the
package-local conformance suites passed React 36/36, Vue 38/38, and Svelte
38/38. The DB build, changed-file ESLint, Prettier, and `git diff --check`
passed. Package-local Vitest configuration is required for the React and Svelte
receiving suites.

Temporary wrong-design controls were built and tested, then removed:

- Restoring the asynchronous success assignment to `false` failed at the
  five-row continuation assertion.
- Leaving the failed continuation frozen through asynchronous success failed
  at the four-row exact-exhaustion assertion (`true` versus `false`).
- Clearing the error on later success failed the earlier Error identity
  assertion (`undefined` versus the sentinel Error).

A review suggested testing an additional synchronous page-success branch. A
legal synchronous-success cell was reached by preparing the physical five-row
window first. It passed with the synchronous assignment changed back to
`false`: that mutant survived. The assignment was therefore removed from the
fix. At synchronous success, `requestPageCount` has cleared an earlier error;
a still-pending preload failure can run only after that synchronous call and
then recomputes continuation itself. The surviving mutant and execution order
make the synchronous assignment irrelevant to the reported public failure
state. This does not claim all synchronous window behavior is covered.

## ORC-001 through ORC-011

| Requirement | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| ORC-001 authority and limits | Pass. The maintainer selected the overlap rule. The executable contract and coverage map name the direct-controller boundary and hook limit. |
| ORC-002 independent judgment | Pass. Expected continuation comes from source length and committed page count. The model imports no production window classifier or failure cache. |
| ORC-003 visible responsibilities | Pass. The shared contract, pure expected snapshot, bounded matrix, production driver, and public comparisons are adjacent in the shared suite and its contract module. |
| ORC-004 generated grammar controls | Not applicable. The four histories are an explicit finite matrix, not a generated-history or input-grammar claim. |
| ORC-005 path and observation | Pass. The driver asserts both physical window limits and observes rows, pages, params, continuation, fetching state, status, and error after each controlled settlement and recovery. |
| ORC-006 checker calibration | Pass for the asynchronous overlap. The three controls above failed by assertion at the intended public checkpoints. The synchronous assignment mutant survived and is reported as such. |
| ORC-007 fixed/random campaigns | Not applicable. This is a bounded scenario, not an important generated property. |
| ORC-008 model minimality | Not applicable. Expected snapshots are stateless recomputation from scenario inputs; no mutable reference-model state changed. |
| ORC-009 vocabulary mapping | Pass. `pageSucceeded` represents two committed pages; `preloadFailed` represents the observable retained pagination error. The model does not represent physical lease state. |
| ORC-010 failure fidelity and cleanup | Pass. The scenario resolves both held gates in `finally`, waits for both operations, disposes the controller, and restores the spy. `ScenarioLifetime` cleans the dependent live query before its source and preserves a primary assertion if cleanup also fails. No shrinking is involved. |
| ORC-011 second formulation | Not applicable. No additional shared-fault hypothesis was identified that a second formulation would distinguish within this direct-controller boundary. Four and five rows already reject opposite wrong continuation rules. |

This record supplies ORC-012 evidence for semantic head `f42fbcf4a642bc936e91309241137325c6f034e3`.
It claims closure only for a failed initial preload overlapping an asynchronous
second-page success on finite ordered local rows at the stated checkpoints.
The coverage map retains framework hook scheduling and other acquisition
paths outside this owner; a reachable counterexample there would require a
separate witness.

## Follow-up: subscribed source updates under a retained error

Reviewed semantic head: `29d46e184981a2841d60e814904571642c81a021`.
This section preserves the earlier exact-head decision above. It extends the
same direct-controller boundary after both overlap settlements, while the
earlier pagination error remains visible and a controller subscriber is active.

The source-length model now checks a later insertion of the fifth row after a
four-row overlap and a later removal of the fifth row after a five-row overlap.
The observer must first publish the changed rows in the live-query Collection.
At that checkpoint, the public controller snapshot must retain the original
error and update `hasNextPage` to match the committed two-page prefix and the
current source extent. Both settlement orders are included, followed by
explicit recovery: four histories and 16 public checkpoints per receiving
driver. An unsubscribed controller has no observer-update claim.

On the prior head, insertion produced five published rows and retained the
error but reported `hasNextPage: false` instead of `true`; removal produced
four rows and reported `true` instead of `false`. Both were public assertion
failures. The permanent shared conformance cell failed on the original
implementation at the first insertion checkpoint. The fix refreshes the
cached continuation on a ready observer notification while a pagination error
is visible, without changing the error lifetime. After the fix, targeted
overlap cells passed in React, Vue, and Svelte; the DB controller suite passed
75/75, and full receiving suites passed React 36/36, Vue 38/38, and Svelte
38/38. Changed-file ESLint, Prettier, and `git diff --check` passed.

Two temporary synchronous-success probes also reached literal-`true` page
success. One held an earlier preload failure until after synchronous page
commit; that later failure recomputed continuation correctly. The other began
with a visible error, which cleared before synchronous page commit. Both
passed and were removed. They support the earlier record's narrow statement
that the surviving synchronous-assignment mutant does not cause the reported
retained-error failure; they do not claim complete synchronous-path coverage.

This follow-up supplies ORC-012 evidence for semantic head
`29d46e184981a2841d60e814904571642c81a021`. It closes the subscribed,
ready-observer source-update cell for these finite ordered rows and public
checkpoints. Framework hook overlap scheduling and other acquisition paths
remain outside the claim, as recorded in the coverage map.

## Follow-up: detached snapshot reads under a retained error

Reviewed semantic head: `fa5a3185` (branch `codex/audit-dec-03`). The earlier
sections retain their exact-head claims. This follow-up extends the same shared
conformance owner to a controller with no active subscriber. The preloaded live
query retains a five-row physical window. After a subscribed source update and
unsubscribe, a second source write reverses the fifth row's presence. A direct
`getSnapshot()` read must derive continuation from those current rows while
preserving the earlier error until explicit recovery. Four or five source rows
cross both settlement orders. The shared model still computes its answer from
source length and committed page count, not the controller's cached value. The
cell now checks 20 public snapshots in each receiving driver.

At parent head `0b0ca99c`, React's public snapshot had the correct four rows
and retained error after the detached removal, but `hasNextPage` remained
`true` instead of `false`. The same oracle was green after moving continuation
recomputation from the subscriber callback into `getSnapshot()`. It also covers
the reverse four-to-five-row transition. The DB controller suite passed 75/75,
and the full receiving suites passed React 36/36, Vue 38/38, and Svelte 38/38
before the final one-line simplification. The DB package was built before the
Svelte run, which imports its built entry point. After that simplification,
the DB suite passed 75/75 and the focused shared cell passed in all three
receiving drivers. Changed-file ESLint, Prettier, and `git diff --check` passed.

A separate temporary control reached the synchronous page-success assignment
with a held earlier preload failure. Replacing that assignment with a throw
failed at the intended line; changing its value from `false` to `true` left the
public error snapshot correct because the later failure recomputed
continuation. Both controls were restored, then the dead synchronous write was
removed. This supports only the stated execution order; it does not prove
every synchronous history equivalent.

The rereview's broader explanation that every error-entry path recomputes
continuation is too strong. The `requestPageCount` synchronous throw and
asynchronous rejection paths preserve a captured `previousHasNextPage` value.
Those paths do not read the dead synchronous assignment. Their distinct
overlap histories are not established by the diagnostic probe above.

ORC-001 through ORC-003 remain grounded in the maintainer's overlap decision,
the source-length model, and the adjacent shared contract/model/driver/check.
ORC-004 and ORC-007 remain inapplicable because the four histories form an
explicit bounded matrix. ORC-005 reaches the exported controller in all three
package realms and compares rows, pages, params, continuation, fetching,
status, and error at the detached read. ORC-006 is supported by the original
RED result and the same-path synchronous controls above. ORC-008 is
inapplicable because the reference has no mutable state. ORC-009 maps
`pageSucceeded` and `preloadFailed` as in the earlier section. ORC-010 retains
the scenario's controlled gate release and cleanup. ORC-011 remains
inapplicable within this direct-controller boundary because no new plausible
shared semantic fault requiring a second formulation was identified. This
section supplies ORC-012 evidence for the named semantic head.

The added claim covers a detached `getSnapshot()` after the preloaded source
publishes a change within a retained physical window. It makes no notification
claim without a subscriber. Hook scheduling, arbitrary provider acquisition,
and other source-state transitions remain outside this cell.

## Post-merge validation

Semantic head `5dfd32c7` merges current `origin/main` through `e16d46ce`
without changing the controller or its oracle. On that merged head, the DB
build passed; the controller suite passed 75/75; and the full React, Vue, and
Svelte receiving suites passed 36/36, 38/38, and 38/38. Changed-file ESLint,
Prettier, and diff checks passed. The full PR's controller source diff against
the merge base is 9 additions and 10 deletions: net minus one production line.

Main later advanced to `68f0b65c`. Merge head `3e930add` preserved the
window-controller coverage row and main's new hash-oracle row. The controller
and shared conformance owner did not change in this merge. The DB build and
full DB, React, Vue, and Svelte suites passed again at the same counts.
