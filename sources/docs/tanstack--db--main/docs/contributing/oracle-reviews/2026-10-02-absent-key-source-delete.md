# Source delete for a key the source never held

Base revision: `06cab6fc7` (`main` after #2005). Tested revision:
`74e5b80d6`. Production code is unchanged from the base revision.

## Contract

A source may delete a key it does not hold. A typical cause: the backend
accepted an optimistic insert, then deleted the row before the source
streamed it. The maintainer decision for this owner is:

- An accepted optimistic snapshot of the key retires, as it does for any
  ordinary source publication. The row disappears.
- An active request for the key stays in place. The delete removes no base
  row and acknowledges no request.

`main` already behaves this way. This review adds the generated histories
and witnesses. It changes no production code.

## Gap

The coverage map listed the case as open. The optimistic-history driver
dropped every delete for a key the source did not hold before the model or
the Collection saw it. So no optimistic-history campaign ever wrote such a
delete.

## Witnesses

- The driver keeps deletes for keys the source does not hold and counts them.
  The fixed campaign must write at least one, beside deletes of held keys.
- Three pinned histories in
  `collection-state-retention-oracle.property.test.ts` accept an optimistic
  insert and then delete its key from a source that never held it. They cover
  a queued delete, an immediate delete, and a delete written inside the
  insert handler.
- A fourth pinned history writes an immediate delete while the insert is
  still active. The row stays visible through settlement.

## ORC outcomes

The record claims a repaired generated-history grammar, so ORC-012 applies.
Each requirement follows.

- **ORC-001 contract authority and limits: met.** The maintainer decision
  above is the authority. The oracle's opening prose states the contract,
  and Limits below states what it does not claim.
- **ORC-002 independent judgment: met.** The model applies its existing drain
  rule. Every ordinary source publication retires accepted snapshots, and a
  source delete acknowledges no request. The model reads no production state
  and imports no production classifier.
- **ORC-003 distinguishable responsibilities: met.**
  `optimistic-history-oracle.ts` keeps the contract prose, the
  `HistoryModel`, the driver `runOptimisticHistory`, and its per-step refinement
  check apart. The grammar lives in
  `collection-state-retention-oracle.property.test.ts` as `sourceBatch` and
  `optimisticHistory`.
- **ORC-004 grammar controls: met, with one gap.**
  - Reconstruction: the four pinned histories are legal histories of the
    grammar. Edits and source deletes both draw keys from 1 to 3.
  - Ablation and range: the fixed-campaign control requires absent-key
    deletes, and it requires more deletes in total than absent-key deletes, so
    held-key deletes remain.
  - Exclusion: the driver no longer filters deletes. The source still writes
    `insert` only for a key it lacks.
  - Gap: no counter shows that the generator reaches an absent-key delete
    while an accepted snapshot of the same key exists. The pinned histories
    reach that premise directly.
- **ORC-005 production path and observation: met.** The driver writes through
  the real sync `begin`, `write`, and `commit` API of a Collection. After each
  step it compares public rows, both subscribers' replicas, downstream query
  rows, and request outcomes with the model.
- **ORC-006 checker calibration: met.** A hostile mutant rejects a sync delete
  for a key absent from the source projection. With the old grammar, the
  optimistic-history campaigns pass under it. Only the separate retained
  authoritative state property fails, and that property has no optimistic
  layers. With the new grammar, the fixed and random optimistic-history
  campaigns and the three accepted-insert histories fail. This ran on the
  tree of `af0b8648a`. `74e5b80d6` adds only the fourth pinned history. A
  mutant that drops any delete for a key absent from `syncedData` is too broad
  to distinguish the change. The old grammar already kills it through queued
  deletes of held keys.
- **ORC-007 fixed and random campaigns: met.** The fixed campaign uses seed
  86103. The random campaign runs under the property name
  `collection-state.optimistic-history`, which accepts a seed and path for
  replay. Both pass on `74e5b80d6`, and so do the 153 tests in the four files
  that use the driver. On `af0b8648a`, the `@tanstack/db` suite passed 244
  files and 8,269 tests.
- **ORC-008 stateful-model minimality: not applicable.** The model gains no
  state and loses none. An absent-key delete takes the existing delete branch
  of the drain.
- **ORC-009 vocabulary mapping: met, with a recorded term.** "Accepted
  snapshot" maps to a completed direct mutation that the Collection retains
  until source publication. The model's existing `retired` flag means that
  the snapshot stopped overlaying the base. That differs from the glossary's
  demand retirement. This change keeps the existing model term and does not
  rename it.
- **ORC-010 failure fidelity and cleanup: not applicable.** This change alters
  no shrinking, capture, or cleanup path. The driver keeps its existing
  `withHistoryCleanup`.
- **ORC-011 independent second formulation: not applicable.** No reviewer
  named a fault that production and the model could share for this case.
- **ORC-012 review evidence: met by this record.**
- **ORC-013 distinguishing witness: met, with one limit.** The law is
  conditional: an accepted snapshot retires, but an active request stays. The
  accepted-insert histories reach the first side. The active-insert history is
  the nearby witness for the second side. A wrong design that also removed the
  active row would differ from the model at the step after the delete. No
  mutant demonstrates that rejection.
- **ORC-014 controlled-premise handoff: not applicable.** The oracle uses no
  controlled provider or host. The source is the Collection's own sync API.

## Limits

An immediate delete that arrives while the insert is active leaves the
accepted row until the next source publication. That follows the existing
rule that a delete acknowledges no request. Immediate sync batches are
scheduled for removal in a separate change, so this record does not revisit
that rule.

## Update, 2026-10-05: settlement-drop law

The record above describes the retention law that was current on
`06cab6fc7`. The settlement-drop change replaces that law. See
[the settlement-drop review](2026-10-03-settlement-drop.md). The following
now applies to this owner:

- A source delete for a key the source never held removes no applied synced
  row and acknowledges no request.
- If the source commits the delete while the transaction persists, or inside
  its handler, the delete is queued. The completed row is held, and the drop
  and the delete publish together. The row is gone after settlement.
- Once the optimistic state has dropped, the delete changes no visible row.
- A persisting transaction keeps its optimistic row. This includes a truncate
  that carries the delete: the truncate applies at once, beneath that row.
- The `immediate` dimension is gone, because `begin({ immediate })` was
  removed.

The pinned histories in `collection-state-retention-oracle.property.test.ts`
now cover these cases:

- a queued delete;
- a delete inside the handler;
- a delete after the drop;
- a persisting insert with a queued delete;
- a persisting insert with a truncate delete.

The driver and its counters are unchanged.

Mutants on the merged branch:

- **Reject (throw on) a delete for a key absent from the source projection:**
  killed. The state-retention oracle fails 11 tests, including the fixed and
  random campaigns and the pinned histories.
- **Silently drop the same delete:** survived, and is equivalent under the
  new law. The key is absent from the applied synced rows, and the
  optimistic state drops at settlement whether or not a queued sync
  transaction touches the key. So readers see the same rows and the same
  publications. Under the retention law, this delete was what retired the
  accepted snapshot, so the mutant was observable there.

The ORC-004 gap and the ORC-013 limit recorded above still apply.
