## Contract and checked boundary

The optimizer's predicate-pushdown contract permits a predicate on a
nonnullable outer-join source to enter that source. The joined row still needs
the predicate, so its outer copy is residual and must not be pushed again.
A predicate on a nullable source stays regular. One logical predicate should
enter each eligible source once, including when optimization runs again.
The public-row contract requires the same result as applying predicates after
the join. These rules follow the optimizer's documented pushdown behavior and
the established outer-join tests.

The finite structural grammar crosses LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, and FULL joins with
separate or AND-combined clauses, both clause orders, and one or two active
predicates. Fixed extensions cover a LEFT/INNER chain with two pushed sources,
same-source OR, cross-source equality, greater-than, nullable-field
`isUndefined`, and an already residual outer clause. The checkpoint is the
returned `optimizeQuery` IR, both initially and after re-optimization.
The oracle counts each predicate in its source and outer WHERE and checks the
outer residual marker and clause count. Plain-array LEFT, RIGHT, and
three-source join models separately check the first public snapshot of a
live-query Collection, with matched and unmatched source rows.

## RED, GREEN, and code weight

| Subject | Result at the intended checkpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Original optimizer, full expanded oracle | 21 failed, 28 passed. Source copies multiply and outer residual markers disappear; the new greater-than witness alone fails at source predicate multiplicity. |
| Contributor's supplied patch, full expanded oracle | 1 failed, 48 passed. A later pass with an existing residual leaves three outer WHERE clauses, while the law expects one regular and one residual group. Predicate multiplicities and markers pass that case. |
| Candidate partition-and-combine repair, full expanded oracle | 49 passed. The candidate combines each regular/residual group once inside `applyOptimizations` and removes caller-side residual reassembly. |
| Candidate, optimizer, join, and join-subquery suites | 247 passed after the predicate-kind case was added. |
| Wrong-design controls | Marking regular clauses residual fails on `member.userId`'s marker. Keeping only the first residual fails on the missing `tag.region` predicate. Both are assertion failures at the structural checkpoint, not setup failures or timeouts. |

At the initial reviewed candidate, the production change added 20 lines and
removed 28, net **minus eight**. The executable oracle added 533 lines. The
loss-audit follow-up has separate code-weight figures below.

## Oracle guide audit

| ID | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| ORC-001 | The contract above states the optimizer and outer-join law, authority, finite grammar, and observations. The coverage map owns omitted expressions, join chains, and publication histories. |
| ORC-002 | The structural expectation is an explicit relational-side table, not the optimizer's nullable-source classifier. The public result models join and filter plain arrays; they import neither optimizer analysis nor compiler evaluation. |
| ORC-003 | The oracle opening states the contract, model, grammar, driver, and checkpoints. The table and array models give the answer; `optimizeQuery` and `createLiveQueryCollection` are the production drivers; assertions are adjacent to each case. |
| ORC-004 | The finite matrix claims only its stated input grammar. Reconstruction: each of 4 join kinds × 2 clause forms × 2 clause orders × 2 predicate counts is constructed and run. Ablation: join kind changes nullable-side eligibility; clause form tests residual-marker retention after combination; order checks order independence; the extra predicate checks same-source multiplicity. Range: one or two active predicates, with the FULL no-push case, are the bounds. Exclusion: unknown source aliases are outside this valid-query grammar; UNION, arbitrary functions, and incremental histories are outside the claim. This records the controls even though the guide distinguishes finite enumeration from an important generated property. |
| ORC-005 | Structural work is observed at the `optimizeQuery` return and after a later pass. The public driver observes exact projected rows at the first synchronous Collection snapshot. The recorder preserves duplicate predicate terms and result rows. |
| ORC-006 | The original implementation and two wrong designs fail at the intended assertions. The contributor's partial fix also fails the later-pass clause-count assertion. |
| ORC-007 | Not applicable: there is no important generated property or random campaign. Every enumerated case runs in the package oracle test file. |
| ORC-008 | Not applicable: the structural table and public array models are stateless; no model state is merged or split. |
| ORC-009 | Source Collection, live-query Collection, public row, public snapshot, and checkpoint use the glossary meanings. The model's `teamPush` and `memberPush` booleans describe expected source placement, not production states. |
| ORC-010 | Not applicable: the fixed tests do not shrink, record mutable traces, or perform cleanup that could replace an assertion failure. |
| ORC-011 | The plain-array public result is a different formulation from the structural predicate-count law. It checks the plausible shared fault that a plan with fewer predicates changed joined rows, including unmatched rows. It does not independently prove optimizer work cost. |
| ORC-012 | This record scores every applicable requirement and identifies non-applicable triggers. The closure claim is limited to the stated grammar, paths, and checkpoints; remaining cells are assigned in the coverage map. |
| ORC-013 | The original ten-copy result and the repaired one-copy result distinguish the once-only law from repeated pushdown. LEFT and RIGHT active-side cases distinguish the relational-side boundary from a LEFT-only rule; FULL is the no-push control. The existing-residual case rejects a plausible partial grouping. |
| ORC-014 | Not applicable to the structural path, which has no controlled provider. The public driver uses synchronous in-memory source Collections and claims only their first snapshot; it does not claim an external-provider handoff. |

This closes the reported repeated-pushdown class for the finite structural
grammar and initial public-result paths above. Arbitrary expression trees,
more complex join chains, and incremental source changes or publication
histories remain open cells for the optimizer-semantics owner. The current
tests give no wall-clock runtime guarantee.

## Package-wide validation

After building the isolated candidate package, the parent audit ran
`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p packages/db/tsconfig.json --pretty false`
successfully. The full `packages/db` Vitest suite then passed 229 files and
7,937 tests with no type errors using `--testTimeout=120000`. This resolves
the earlier self-package declaration setup errors. The structural and public
history bounds above remain unchanged.

## Loss-audit follow-up

The audit found a real adjacent predicate-preservation defect: with a join,
`groupWhereClauses` silently discarded a clause that touched no source. A
`Value(false)` after an active-side filter therefore vanished, and the first
public live-query Collection snapshot contained three rows instead of none.
The structural predicate-preservation assertion and the public snapshot test
both failed before the repair and passed afterward. The repair retains every
clause without exactly one pushable source in the outer WHERE. Three older
optimizer tests expected source-free or malformed clauses to disappear; their
false-green expectations now assert preservation.

The structural matrix now checks both `optimizedQuery` and
`sourceWhereClauses`, including nullable-source exclusion. Replacing the latter
with an empty map failed the left-join matrix case at the intended assertion
(`[]` versus `['team']`). Fixed extensions check a namespace-only predicate,
later RIGHT/FULL joins that make earlier aliases nullable, and an ordered
QueryRef that declines pushdown. Each checks the first and later optimizer
pass. The source-free case also checks public rows. These extensions do not
establish public results for the later join chains or all QueryRef refusal
reasons. UNION remains a separate optimizer path.

The parallel preparation review found that the structural term reader ignored
predicate values. It could not distinguish `team.active=true` from
`team.active=false`. The reader now records literal values and rejects
unexpected compared expressions. A calibration test failed when an equality
literal was deliberately hidden, then passed with the corrected reader. The
main matrix also checks those values in pushed and residual predicates.
The duplicate focused LEFT JOIN test was removed because the matrix receives
its trace and its original-implementation RED evidence.

The final branch diff against the fetched `origin/main` adds 22 production
lines and removes 31, net **minus nine**. The executable oracle adds 762 lines;
the existing optimizer tests add 23 and remove 13. Tests and review documents
are reported separately from production code.

At the code-bearing head, the full `packages/db/tests` suite passed 197 files
and 7,675 tests with two Vitest threads and a 120-second test timeout. The
package TypeScript check, focused ESLint, Prettier, and diff check passed.
An earlier sandboxed full run could not write Vitest's temporary cache and
failed its replay calibration; the same suite passed with that cache writable.
