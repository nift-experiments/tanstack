The repair adds a bounded initial-settlement refinement to the existing ordered
lifecycle owner. It does not change the owner's generated 192-cell lifecycle
product or nullable multi-term product. It adds the missing fixed-seed campaign
for the existing nullable property without changing that property's domain.

| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ORC-001     | Pass. `ARCHITECTURE.md` now names the synchronous initial-query observation cut: an ordinary initial ordered chain whose acquisitions return literal `true` after their establishing applied receipts are visible drains its synchronous continuations and graph work before the initiating call stack returns. It excludes source exhaustion, broader coverage, explicit windows, repair, replay, and framework render-time behavior.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ORC-002     | Pass. `expectedInitialSettlementObservation` derives the expected rows and initial-query status from a two-row finite source and the public literal-`true` versus Promise contract. It imports no ordered-loader classifier, continuation state, generation, or production helper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ORC-003     | Pass. The opening states the contract and limits; `InitialSettlementShape` plus the four indexed/prefix cells are the bounded grammar; `expectedInitialSettlementObservation` is the model; `observeInitialSettlement` is the production driver; and the observation, acquisition-path, boundary-continuation, and release checks form the refinement check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ORC-004     | Not applicable to the new refinement. It is a fully enumerated deterministic 2×2 grammar and makes no generated-history coverage claim. The four cells reconstruct both settlement shapes across an observed indexed page and unindexed prefix request; both require the predicate-only boundary continuation. The Promise cell is the adjacent non-synchronous state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ORC-005     | Pass. The driver uses a real on-demand source, `createLiveQueryCollection`, a live subscription, and public `preload()`. It records the same-call-stack and settled rows/status, exact first-request shape, predicate-only boundary continuation, and request/release identity. `sync.commit() === true` is the positive witness that every establishing write and event was applied before the adapter returned literal `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ORC-006     | Pass. `rejects the old Promise-wrapped observation at the synchronous checkpoint` supplies the prior design's exact wrong answer. The refinement check rejects its empty/loading observation as an assertion failure. A temporary adversarial mutation that routed indexed acquisition through the prefix path initially passed all five focused tests; after the request classifiers were added, both eager-index cells failed with observed `prefix` versus expected `page`. Existing direct-loader controls separately reject synchronous write-then-throw, cleanup reentry, and unsafe continuation designs. |
| ORC-007     | Pass. The owner has two important generated properties. Ordered lifecycle and nullable multi-term lifecycle now each run identical fixed-seed and seedless-random lanes with the same arbitrary, production observer, refinement check, run count, and timeout. The random nullable lane retains direct seed-and-path replay through `ordered-work.nullable-lifecycle`. The deterministic initial-settlement refinement remains outside those generated campaigns.                                                                                                                                               |
| ORC-008     | Not applicable. The new finite model is stateless recomputation; it does not introduce, combine, split, or remove state in a stateful reference model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ORC-009     | Pass. Model `synchronous` means the adapter returns literal `true`; `promise` means it returns `Promise<void>`. Existing `AcquisitionPath` prose maps indexed ordered work to `page` and unindexed ordered work to `prefix`. The observed checkpoint is named initial query readiness, distinct from Collection and subscription readiness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ORC-010     | Pass. The refinement performs no shrinking or capture. Its driver releases the live subscription and cleans both live and source Collections in `finally`; it then checks exact request/release identity. The existing lifecycle owner retains failure diagnostics, abort observations, terminal cleanup, and one-release checks for failing histories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ORC-011     | Pass. The named shared-fault risk is collapsing an adapter's return with public visibility before applied receipts or continuation complete. The source driver requires `commit() === true`; warm Query-cache integration tests exercise a different adapter path with zero fetches; and React receiving-driver tests independently observe first non-idle layout-commit rows/status while preserving render-time inactivity.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ORC-012     | Pass. This versioned record reports ORC-001 through ORC-011 and is tied to the exact reviewed semantic head above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Verification receipts

- Unfiltered ordered lifecycle owner: 228 tests passed, including fixed and
  random lanes for both generated properties and the four new
  initial-settlement cells.
- Guarded nullable-lifecycle replay reached seed `93472`, path `0`, executed 20
  runs, and reported the requested property witness.
- Full DB oracle campaign: 40 files and 2,135 tests passed.

The source-isolated loss audit is preserved outside the repository at
`/private/tmp/pr2-query-readiness-loss-audit.md`; verdict-critical evidence is
repeated here so this record does not depend on that temporary file.

## Cross-source synchronous work follow-up

- Base: `0eb5b85ddf127e7c2fe5f23dbed2c3f9056c0ea7`.
- Reviewed semantic head: `c4689b746b2e3c402909ee7f05fe38a85a3005c0`.
- Added history: an indexed ordered `FROM` source reaches its predicate-only
  boundary continuation while a sibling `LEFT JOIN` source synchronously adds
  enough rows to fill the initial limit.

| Requirement | Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ORC-001     | Pass. The architecture now requires graph work before another ordered acquisition when any sibling subscriber added synchronous input. The evidence is limited to the initial synchronous cut and does not claim behavior for asynchronous settlement, deoptimized joins, repair, replay, or explicit window moves. |
| ORC-002     | Pass. The expected two-row join and two-request trace come from a finite one-left/two-right relation and the graph-wide input law. The check imports no loader revision, continuation, or top-K helper.                                                                                                             |
| ORC-003     | Pass. The existing owner retains its contract, finite reference, bounded grammar, real live-query driver, and public refinement checks. The fixed cross-source history adds request-work and ready/immediate row observations without changing the generated models.                                                |
| ORC-004     | Not applicable. The follow-up is one deterministic regression and makes no generated-history coverage claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ORC-005     | Pass. The driver uses two real source subscriptions and an indexed ordered live query. It proves the page and boundary paths ran, records the exact adapter request trace, and checks rows at the ready callback, immediate preload return, and settled checkpoint.                                                 |
| ORC-006     | Pass. At the base, the exact test failed because production issued a third cursor acquisition after the sibling source had already committed enough joined rows. The graph-wide revision removes that request while preserving both rows at every readiness checkpoint.                                             |
| ORC-007     | Not applicable. No important generated property or campaign changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ORC-008     | Not applicable. The follow-up adds no reference-model state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ORC-009     | Pass. `Sibling source input` means changes sent by another `CollectionSubscriber` to the same D2 graph. The production `graphInputRevision` records that graph-wide progress; it is not Collection readiness or source coverage.                                                                                    |
| ORC-010     | Pass. The regression has no shrinking or normalized capture and cleans the live query plus both source Collections in `finally`.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ORC-011     | Not applicable. The exact physical request trace directly distinguishes the reported stale-work fault; no plausible shared semantic fault needs a second formulation.                                                                                                                                               |
| ORC-012     | Pass. This versioned, base-identified follow-up records every ORC-001 through ORC-011 outcome and names the exact reviewed semantic head.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The focused RED run observed page, boundary, then stale cursor acquisition. The
GREEN run observes only page and boundary, with both joined rows visible at all
three readiness checkpoints. Inner and right joins, ordering by a non-`FROM`
alias, and other unsafe plans deoptimize to full-source acquisition and remain
outside this fixed regression.

Verification after the semantic commit: the focused regression passed 1/1; the
complete ordered-lifecycle owner passed 229/229; six surrounding ordered-loader,
ordered-work, and live-query suites passed 311/311; DB build, changed-file lint,
format, and diff checks passed.

## Loss-audit and design-grammar closeout

- Production semantic head: `74e554937a439e89dcadef8ad4a0f61fef0635d4`
- Oracle/test head: `fb6d61421480980ef38037d13ef579e74a3de491`
- Runtime: Node `24.19.0`, pnpm `11.1.0`, Vitest `3.2.4`
- Extraction target: the smallest oracle grammar that preserves ordered initial
  readiness, graph progress, repair precedence, and failure evidence without
  multiplying unrelated lifecycle dimensions.

The closeout changed tests and oracle evidence only. The intended production
behavior remains the behavior at the semantic head. The loss audit recovered
independent ordering directions, continuation depth, Promise-parent ownership,
captured-failure replay, and primary-versus-cleanup diagnostics as material
properties that the earlier review did not fully preserve.

### Model

The preservation contract was frozen before the final grammar changes:

| ID | Preserved property | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |

The surviving grammar has four separate subgrammars rather than one artificial
Cartesian product:

1. Initial readiness is `acquisition path × settlement` (`page` or `prefix` by
   literal `true` or Promise), exactly four cells.
2. The existing ordered lifecycle product remains 192 cells:
   acquisition path × delivery phase × window action × outcome × sync-run
   generation × initial/replay barrier.
3. Post-success failure remains its bounded settlement × failure-phase grammar;
   it is not multiplied into initial readiness.
4. Query same-result reentry remains with the Query Collection result-settlement
   owner and is reviewed in the companion result-settlement record.

Graph progress is expressed as three overlays: a quiet multi-step continuation
drain, sibling-source graph progress, and ordering-repair precedence. The
nullable lifecycle grammar retains its 22 declared lifecycle cells and adds a
four-cell primary/secondary direction overlay. Random generation varies both
directions independently. This preserves the missing relation without turning
every lifecycle cell into another four-way product.

### Evidence

Reconstruction reaches every declared cell: four initial-settlement cells, all
192 original lifecycle histories, all 22 nullable lifecycle cells, and all four
direction pairs. Exact uniqueness checks prevent a duplicated declaration from
masquerading as coverage. A four-step synchronous trace
`page → boundary → page → boundary` proves continuation depth rather than only
one-step reentry.

One-at-a-time ablation gave each retained coordinate a distinct job:

- Removing settlement shape erases the synchronous-versus-Promise readiness
  boundary; removing acquisition path erases indexed page versus unindexed
  prefix behavior.
- Removing any original lifecycle axis erases a distinct public checkpoint,
  request shape, terminal outcome, sync generation, window transition, or
  replay barrier.
- Coupling the two sort directions removes `asc/asc` and `desc/desc`; the
  four-cell overlay prevents that false grammar.
- Removing quiet drain, sibling progress, or repair precedence respectively
  permits shallow return, stale extra acquisition, or stale-continuation work.
- Removing Promise-parent retention permits a continuation failure to discard a
  successful acquisition that repair still needs.
- Removing failure-safe cleanup lets a teardown error hide the oracle mismatch.

The nearby invalid designs are therefore concrete: readiness before applied
receipts and continuations, a third stale acquisition after sibling progress,
ordinary continuation before repair, early parent release after a continuation
failure, coupled sort directions, and cleanup replacement of the primary
failure. Explicit-window histories, replay histories, repair histories, and
Effect scheduling remain valid neighboring domains, but their laws stay with
their existing owners. Framework render-time scheduling is outside this
grammar.

The independent formulations have deliberately narrower equivalence claims:

- Direct source and warm Query cache must agree on final rows and readiness,
  while a warm cache has no source acquisition chain to compare.
- Direct source and React must agree on rows and status at React's receiving
  checkpoint; this says nothing about render-time scheduling.
- The sibling-source wait-for-graph history adds an exact physical request
  trace, so it constrains work as well as final rows.

### Process

The extraction source was frozen at the production semantic head, with the
architecture, oracle guide, coverage map, ordered lifecycle owner, loader
regressions, Query Collection owner, and existing framework/cache formulations
as named evidence. Production semantics were not changed to satisfy the
grammar. Candidate coordinates survived only when reconstruction or
one-at-a-time ablation showed a distinct law, checkpoint, exclusion, or active
overlap; otherwise they remained separate overlays or with their existing
owner.

Two hostile controls demonstrate detection and replay:

- A temporary early-release mutant made the Promise-parent continuation test
  fail at the exact lease assertion. Restoring production made the focused test
  pass.
- A temporary `secondary-order` fault failed the random nullable property at
  seed `-1998078481`, shrink path `0:0:0:0:0`, after four shrinks. Direct replay
  with `TANSTACK_DB_ORACLE_PROPERTY=ordered-work.nullable-lifecycle` reproduced
  the same `success-rows` mismatch with zero additional shrinks. Restoring the
  oracle made that exact replay pass.

The cleanup control injects one primary mismatch and two teardown failures. It
proves both teardown callbacks run, the `AggregateError.cause` is the primary
mismatch, and `errors` retains the primary plus both cleanup diagnostics in
order.

The decomposition loss is explicit: separate subgrammars do not prove every
cross-product interaction. The overlays preserve the intersections implicated
by the issue and loss audit; unrelated combinations remain with their existing
owners. This avoids combinatorial confidence without hiding the boundary.

### ORC disposition at the oracle/test head

| Requirement | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| ORC-001 | Pass. DG-P1 through DG-P10 name the intended laws, authorities, and exclusions. |
| ORC-002 | Pass. Expected rows come from finite-source sorting and slicing; settlement and ownership expectations come from public contracts, not loader continuation or repair machinery. |
| ORC-003 | Pass. The opening contract, scenario grammar, finite reference, real live-query driver, and mismatch/refinement checks remain visible and distinguishable. |
| ORC-004 | Pass. Reconstruction, one-at-a-time ablation, bounded range, overlays, and nearby invalid designs are recorded above; executable uniqueness checks guard the enumerated cells. |
| ORC-005 | Pass. Real source Collections and live queries expose rows, status, requests, releases, repair, and readiness at named checkpoints. |
| ORC-006 | Pass. The early-release mutant and secondary-order fault both reached their intended checkpoints and failed by assertion; neither was a setup failure or timeout. |
| ORC-007 | Pass. Both important generated properties retain equal fixed and random campaigns, and the captured nullable failure was replayed directly by seed, shrink path, and property name. |
| ORC-008 | Not applicable. The closeout introduces no reference-model state and neither combines nor splits existing model states. |
| ORC-009 | Pass. Settlement, acquisition, graph input, repair, readiness, replay, and applied receipt retain their architecture/glossary meanings; overlay-only terms are identified above. |
| ORC-010 | Pass. The harness preserves the primary failure as cause, retains every cleanup diagnostic, attempts all cleanup callbacks, and has an executable hostile control. |
| ORC-011 | Pass. Warm-cache, React receiving-driver, and sibling wait-for-graph formulations state exactly which observations are equivalent and which work or scheduling facts differ. |
| ORC-012 | Pass. This section records every ORC-001 through ORC-011 outcome against exact semantic and oracle/test heads. |

Verification at the oracle/test head: the ordered loader and lifecycle owners
passed 298/298 with test type checking; the Query Collection ownership owner
passed 227/227 across runtime and source type-check projects. DB and Query
Collection builds passed. Changed-file lint reported no errors (two existing
`require-await` warnings remain elsewhere in the Query Collection owner), and
format plus diff checks passed.

The architecture already required an explicit underfilled window to acquire its
missing prefix. It now states the adjacent continuation rule directly: a
staged boundary with no boundary row starts no acquisition, so consuming it
cannot settle the enlarged window operation.

The bounded design grammar crosses two independent axes:

- settled source boundary: absent or present;
- remaining explicit-window demand: satisfied or widened.

`expectedStagedWindowTrace` is a stateless immediate-work model. Every history
starts with the finite page that creates the staged continuation. A present
boundary then requires its tie acquisition. A widened window then requires a
page acquisition; with no boundary, that page starts at the source prefix. The
four-cell calibration proves that every declared combination appears once.

The production driver reaches the loader path without timing:

1. An indexed finite acquisition returns literal `true` with no rows while the
   graph-input revision changes.
2. The loader retains an ordinary staged boundary continuation but no settled
   source boundary.
3. The driver varies boundary presence, either satisfies or enlarges the
   window, and calls `loadMore(1)`.
4. The refinement check compares the complete page/boundary/page request trace,
   synchronous versus pending settlement, and exact widened request shape.

At the base, the same-path RED failed because `loadMore(1)` returned `undefined`
after consuming the empty continuation and started no second acquisition. The
fix returns only when continuation consumption starts pending work. Otherwise,
normal demand selection handles the enlarged window. The active-state check
also preserves synchronous disposal reentry.

The earlier grammar was incomplete. It covered synchronous
multi-continuation draining, staged-continuation repair precedence, and public
window settlement separately. They did not cross graph-input change, an empty
finite result, the resulting staged boundary, and a wider explicit window in
one history. The new overlay owns that intersection without multiplying the
192-cell public lifecycle product. Removing the boundary axis loses the tie
versus prefix distinction. Removing the demand axis loses the difference
between an absent boundary that is finished and one that remains underfilled.
The nearby invalid histories are a phantom request for the satisfied absent
cell and a widened prefix that skips the required present-boundary tie. The
public ordered lifecycle owner remains the broader window-settlement authority.

| Requirement | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| ORC-001 | Pass. The architecture owns the empty-boundary continuation law and limits it to an explicit window whose consumed continuation starts no acquisition. It does not claim source exhaustion or revise replay, repair, or framework scheduling. |
| ORC-002 | Pass. The expected request follows from the independently stated window and demand law: an empty boundary proves no prefix, and an enlarged underfilled window requires acquisition from offset zero. The test imports no production continuation classifier. |
| ORC-003 | Pass. The architecture states the law; `expectedStagedWindowTrace` is the stateless model; the two-axis product is the history grammar; the fixture drives the real loader; and exact work plus settlement form the refinement check. |
| ORC-004 | Pass. The four-cell product reconstructs present and absent boundary histories with satisfied and widened demand. Removing either axis loses a distinct legal result. The range is the minimal Boolean product; phantom satisfied work and skipped tie work are the nearby invalid states. |
| ORC-005 | Pass. The driver invokes the real `OrderedSourceLoader.start()` and `loadMore(1)` entry points, proves the staged continuation exists, and observes the complete acquisition trace, exact widened request, and settlement at the post-`loadMore` and completed-chain checkpoints. |
| ORC-006 | Pass. Unchanged production at the base reached every absent/widened precondition and failed by assertion: the pending result was `undefined`, and the second acquisition was absent. The semantic and oracle/test heads pass the strengthened refinement. |
| ORC-007 | Not applicable. No important generated property or campaign changed. |
| ORC-008 | Not applicable. The trace model is stateless. |
| ORC-009 | Pass. Window, boundary, graph-input revision, acquisition, and settlement retain their project glossary and architecture meanings. `expectedStagedWindowTrace` is explicitly an immediate-work projection, not a production lifecycle state. |
| ORC-010 | Pass. Every deferred acquisition is resolved in `finally`, loader disposal still runs, and cleanup cannot replace the recorded refinement mismatch. |
| ORC-011 | Not applicable. The exact pending result and acquisition trace directly distinguish the one disputed control-flow fault; no plausible shared semantic classifier requires a second formulation. |
| ORC-012 | Pass. This versioned follow-up records every ORC-001 through ORC-011 outcome against the exact base, semantic head, and oracle/test head. |

Verification at the oracle/test head: the complete four-cell grammar and its
calibration passed 5/5; the complete ordered-loader suite passed 67/67; the six ordered loader,
state, lifecycle, work, default-work, and demand-retirement owners passed
