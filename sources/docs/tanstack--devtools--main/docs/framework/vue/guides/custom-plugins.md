TanStack devtools allows you to create your own custom plugins by emitting and listening to our event bus.

## Prerequisite

This guide will walk you through a simple example where our library is a counter with a count history. A working example can be found in our [custom-plugin example](https://tanstack.com/devtools/latest/docs/framework/react/examples/custom-devtools).

This is our library code:

counter.ts
```tsx
export function createCounter() {
  let count = 0
  const history = []

  return {
    getCount: () => count,
    increment: () => {
      count++
      history.push(count)
    },
    decrement: () => {
      count--
      history.push(count)
    },
  };
}
```

## Event Client Setup

Install the [TanStack Devtools Event Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/devtools-event-client) utils.

```bash
npm i @tanstack/devtools-event-client
```

First you will need to setup the `EventClient`.

eventClient.ts
```tsx
import { EventClient } from '@tanstack/devtools-event-client'


type EventMap = {
  // The key is the event suffix only — the pluginId is prepended automatically by EventClient
  // The value is the expected type of the event payload
  'counter-state': { count: number, history: number[] }
}

class CustomEventClient extends EventClient<EventMap> {
  constructor() {
    super({
      // The pluginId is prepended to event map keys when emitting/listening
      pluginId: 'custom-devtools',
    })
  }
}

// This is where the magic happens, it'll be used throughout your application.
export const DevtoolsEventClient = new CustomEventClient()
```

## Event Client Integration

Now we need to hook our `EventClient` into the application code. This can be done in many way's, a useEffect that emits the current state, or a subscription to an observer, all that matters is that when you want to emit the current state you do the following.

Our new library code will looks as follows:

counter.ts
```tsx
import { DevtoolsEventClient } from './eventClient.ts'

export function createCounter() {
  let count = 0
  const history: Array<number> = []

  return {
    getCount: () => count,
    increment: () => {
      count++
      history.push(count)

      // The emit eventSuffix must match that of the EventMap defined in eventClient.ts
      DevtoolsEventClient.emit('counter-state', {
        count,
        history,
      })
    },
    decrement: () => {
      count--
      history.push(count)

      DevtoolsEventClient.emit('counter-state', {
        count,
        history,
      })
    },
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `EventClient` is framework agnostic so this process will be the same regardless of framework or even in vanilla JavaScript.

## Consuming The Event Client

Now we need to create our devtools panel, for a simple approach write the devtools in the framework that the adapter is, be aware that this will make the plugin framework specific.

> Because TanStack is framework agnostic we have taken a more complicated approach that will be explained in coming docs (if framework agnosticism is not a concern to you, you can ignore this).

DevtoolPanel.vue
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'
import { DevtoolsEventClient } from './eventClient'

const state = ref<{ count: number; history: number[] }>()

let cleanup: (() => void) | undefined

onMounted(() => {
  cleanup = DevtoolsEventClient.on('counter-state', (e) => {
    state.value = e.payload
  })
})

onUnmounted(() => {
  cleanup?.()
})
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <div>{{ state?.count }}</div>
    <div>{{ JSON.stringify(state?.history) }}</div>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Application Integration

This step follows what's shown in [basic-setup](../basic-setup) for a more documented guide go check it out.

App.vue
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { TanStackDevtools } from '@tanstack/vue-devtools'
import DevtoolPanel from './DevtoolPanel.vue'

const plugins = [
  { name: 'Custom devtools', component: DevtoolPanel },
]
</script>

<template>
  <App />
  <TanStackDevtools :plugins="plugins" />
</template>
```

## Debugging

Both the `TanStackDevtools` component and the TanStack `EventClient` come with built in debug mode which will log to the console the emitted event as well as the EventClient status.

TanStackDevtool's debugging mode can be activated like so:
```vue
<template>
  <TanStackDevtools
    :event-bus-config="{ debug: true }"
    :plugins="[
      {
        name: 'Custom devtools',
        component: DevtoolPanel,
      },
    ]"
  />
</template>
```

Where as the EventClient's debug mode can be activated by:
```tsx
class CustomEventClient extends EventClient<EventMap> {
  constructor() {
    super({
      pluginId: 'custom-devtools',
      debug: true,
    })
  }
}
```

Activating the debug mode will log to the console the current events that emitter has emitted or listened to. The EventClient will have appended `[tanstack-devtools:${pluginId}]` and the client will have appended `[tanstack-devtools:client-bus]`.

Heres an example of both:
```
[tanstack-devtools:client-bus] Initializing client event bus

[tanstack-devtools:custom-devtools-plugin] Registered event to bus custom-devtools:counter-state
```

## Production builds

By default the **root import** of `@tanstack/devtools-event-client` no-ops
outside development. When your bundler sets `process.env.NODE_ENV` to anything
other than `'development'`, the real client is replaced by a no-op and
tree-shaken out of your production bundle:

```ts
// dev: real client — production: no-op (tree-shaken away)
import { EventClient } from '@tanstack/devtools-event-client'
```

If you are an open-source author who deliberately wants devtools events in
production, import the real client from the `/production` subpath instead. It is
never stripped:

```ts
// always the real client, in every environment
import { EventClient } from '@tanstack/devtools-event-client/production'
```

The public API is identical between the two imports — only the production
runtime behavior differs.
