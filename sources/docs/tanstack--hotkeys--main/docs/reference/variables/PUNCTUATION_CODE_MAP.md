Maps `KeyboardEvent.code` values for punctuation keys to their canonical characters.

On macOS, holding the Option (Alt) key transforms punctuation keys into special characters
(e.g., Option+Minus → en-dash '–'), causing `event.key` to differ from the expected character.
However, `event.code` still reports the physical key (e.g., 'Minus'). This map enables
falling back to `event.code` for punctuation keys, similar to the existing `Key*`/`Digit*`
fallbacks for letters and digits.
