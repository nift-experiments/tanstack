```ts
const MODIFIER_KEYS: Set<string>;
```

Defined in: [constants.ts:40](https://github.com/TanStack/hotkeys/blob/main/packages/hotkeys/src/constants.ts#L40)

Set of canonical modifier key names for fast lookup.

Derived from `MODIFIER_ORDER` to ensure consistency. Used to detect when
a modifier is released so we can clear non-modifier keys whose keyup events
may have been swallowed by the OS (e.g. macOS Cmd+key combos).
