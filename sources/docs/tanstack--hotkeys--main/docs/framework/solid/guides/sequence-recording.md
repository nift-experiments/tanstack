Use `createHotkeySequenceRecorder` to capture a series of shortcut chords. By default, each step records its physical code: pressing G twice produces `['[KeyG]', '[KeyG]']`. Set `recordBy: 'key'` to follow logical characters instead. Pass the resulting array directly to sequence registration and format each step for display.

TanStack Hotkeys automatically suppresses registered hotkey and sequence callbacks while any recorder is active. You do not need to set `enabled` from `isRecording`. Registrations remain available for conflict detection, and recorded keys stay suppressed through repeats and key release.

## Reactive options

Recorder options support [property getters and functions returning options](./hotkeys.md#property-getters). Updated callbacks, validation, and recording settings apply during an active session without restarting it. Allow the framework to run its effect or watcher before relying on the update.

## Record and display a sequence

This example uses a Save button so plain Enter can be recorded as a step:

```tsx
import { Show } from 'solid-js'
import { createHotkeySequenceRecorder, formatForDisplay } from '@tanstack/solid-hotkeys'

function SequenceRecorder() {
  const recorder = createHotkeySequenceRecorder({
    commitKeys: 'none',
    onRecord: (sequence) => console.log('Register or persist:', sequence),
    onReject: ({ message }) => console.log(message),
  })
  const label = () =>
    (recorder.isRecording() ? recorder.steps() : recorder.recordedSequence() ?? [])
      .map((step) => formatForDisplay(step)).join(' → ')

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={recorder.startRecording}>Record sequence</button>
      <p>{label()}</p>
      <Show when={recorder.isRecording()}>
        <button onClick={recorder.commitRecording}>Save</button>
        <button onClick={recorder.cancelRecording}>Cancel</button>
      </Show>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## State and controls

The recorder exposes `isRecording`, `steps`, and `recordedSequence` as accessors. `steps` contains the current attempt; `recordedSequence` contains the last committed result. `startRecording()` begins a new session. `commitRecording()` saves a nonempty attempt, while `cancelRecording()` discards it and calls `onCancel`. `stopRecording()` resets recorder state without calling `onRecord` or `onCancel`.

## Options and keyboard behavior

- `recordBy`: `'code'` by default; `'key'` records produced logical characters.
- `commitKeys`: `'enter'` by default; plain Enter commits a nonempty sequence. `'none'` lets Enter become a step and requires manual or idle commit.
- `commitOnEnter: false`: also permits Enter as a step when `commitKeys` is `'enter'`.
- `idleTimeoutMs`: optionally commits after inactivity following a completed step. No timer runs before the first step.
- `ignoreInputs`: true by default, including shadow-root inputs. Set false to record from editable fields. Escape still cancels from an input.

Escape cancels. Unmodified Backspace/Delete removes the last step; when already empty it stops and calls only `onClear`. Modifier-only presses, automatic repeats, and IME composition do not append steps. Recorded events and their releases do not trigger application shortcuts.

Set provider defaults through `HotkeysProvider` with `defaultOptions.hotkeySequenceRecorder`.

## Validation and conflicts

`validate(sequence, { events, parsedSequence })` runs at commit. Return true to accept, or false/a message to reject. `detectConflicts` checks live bindings and sequence prefixes, including physical/logical overlap established by the recorded events. `onReject` receives feedback; rejected steps remain editable with Backspace.

The shared options and exclusions are described in the [hotkey recording guide](./hotkey-recording.md#validation-and-conflicts). The application owns reset, persistence, and any binding being edited; clearing never calls `onRecord([])`.
