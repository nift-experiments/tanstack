TanStack Hotkeys supports multi-key sequences: shortcuts where you press keys one after another rather than simultaneously. Sequences are common in Vim-style navigation, cheat codes, and multi-step commands.

In Lit, registration is declarative via the `@hotkeySequence` decorator, or imperative via `HotkeySequenceController` when the sequence or options are built at runtime. Both use the same singleton `SequenceManager`.

Sequence steps use the same string syntax as single hotkeys. For example, `['[KeyG]', '[KeyG]']` follows a physical position, while `['G', 'G']` follows the logical letter. A sequence can mix forms, such as `['Mod+[KeyK]', 'C']`. Display steps with `sequence.map((step) => formatForDisplay(step)).join(' → ')`.

## Reactive options

Sequence options support the same [property getter patterns](./hotkeys.md#property-getters) as hotkey options, including `enabled`, `timeout`, and `target`. Updates preserve the registration when its sequence, target, and platform stay the same. Use `HotkeySequenceController` for options that depend on the host instance.

## Basic usage

### The `@hotkeySequence` decorator

Decorate a method to run when the user completes the key sequence:

```ts
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit'
import { customElement } from 'lit/decorators.js'
import { hotkeySequence } from '@tanstack/lit-hotkeys'

@customElement('vim-view')
class VimView extends LitElement {
  @hotkeySequence(['G', 'G'])
  scrollTop() {
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })
  }

  render() {
    return html`<div>Press g then g to scroll to top</div>`
  }
}
```

The first argument is an array of `Hotkey` strings representing each step in the sequence. The user must press them in order within the timeout window.

The method receives the `KeyboardEvent` and [`HotkeyCallbackContext`](../../../reference/interfaces/HotkeyCallbackContext.md) like `@hotkey`:

```ts
import type { HotkeyCallbackContext } from '@tanstack/lit-hotkeys'

@hotkeySequence(['G', 'G'])
scrollTop(event: KeyboardEvent, context: HotkeyCallbackContext) {
  console.log(context.hotkey)
}
```

### `HotkeySequenceController`

Use the controller when the sequence or callback cannot be expressed as a static decorator (e.g. data-driven shortcuts):

```ts
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit'
import { customElement } from 'lit/decorators.js'
import { HotkeySequenceController } from '@tanstack/lit-hotkeys'

@customElement('vim-view')
class VimView extends LitElement {
  private scrollTopSeq = new HotkeySequenceController(
    this,
    ['G', 'G'],
    () => this.scrollTop(),
  )

  constructor() {
    super()
    this.addController(this.scrollTopSeq)
  }

  private scrollTop() {
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })
  }

  render() {
    return html`<div>Press g then g to scroll to top</div>`
  }
}
```

## Many sequences at once

Register several sequences on the same element by applying multiple `@hotkeySequence` decorators (one per method), or by adding multiple `HotkeySequenceController` instances with `addController`. There is no Lit equivalent to React's `useHotkeySequences` hook; several decorators on one class are the idiomatic pattern.

```ts
@customElement('vim-navigation')
class VimNavigation extends LitElement {
  @hotkeySequence(['G', 'G'])
  goTop() {
    scrollToTop()
  }

  @hotkeySequence(['G', 'Shift+G'])
  goBottom() {
    scrollToBottom()
  }

  @hotkeySequence(['D', 'D'], { timeout: 500 })
  deleteLine() {
    deleteCurrentLine()
  }

  render() {
    return html`<div></div>`
  }
}
```

## Sequence options

Pass options as the second argument to `@hotkeySequence` (or to `HotkeySequenceController`):

```ts
@hotkeySequence(['G', 'G'], {
  timeout: 1000, // Time allowed between keys (ms)
  enabled: true, // Whether the sequence is active at connect time
})
scrollTop() {
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })
}
```

### `timeout`

The maximum time (in milliseconds) allowed between consecutive key presses. If the user takes longer than this between any two keys, the sequence resets. Defaults to `1000` (1 second).

```ts
@hotkeySequence(['D', 'D'], { timeout: 500 })
deleteLine() {
  deleteCurrentLine()
}

@hotkeySequence(['Shift+Z', 'Shift+Z'], { timeout: 2000 })
forceQuit() {
  quitWithoutSaving()
}
```

### `enabled`

Controls whether the sequence is registered when the element connects. Defaults to `true`. If `enabled` is `false` at connection time, registration is skipped. To turn sequences on or off later, reconnect the element, or create a new `HotkeySequenceController` when your state changes.

```ts
@hotkeySequence(['G', 'G'], { enabled: true })
scrollToTop() {
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })
}
```

### Default options

When you omit options, the library uses the same defaults as the core [`SequenceOptions`](../../../reference/interfaces/SequenceOptions.md): `timeout: 1000`, `preventDefault` / `stopPropagation` enabled, smart `ignoreInputs`, and platform auto-detection. If you omit `target`, the Lit adapter resolves it to `document` when the controller connects in the browser.

### `meta`

Sequences support the same `meta` option as hotkeys. Attach a `name` and `description` for use in shortcut palettes and devtools.

```ts
@hotkeySequence(['G', 'G'], { meta: { name: 'Go to Top', description: 'Scroll to the top of the page' } })
scrollTop() { window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' }) }

// Or with HotkeySequenceController:
new HotkeySequenceController(this, ['G', 'G'], () => this.scrollTop(), {
  meta: { name: 'Go to Top', description: 'Scroll to the top of the page' },
})
```

See the [Hotkeys Guide](./hotkeys.md#metadata-name--description) for details on declaration merging and introspecting registrations.

## Sequences with modifiers

Each step in a sequence can include modifiers:

```ts
@hotkeySequence(['Mod+K', 'Mod+C'])
commentSelection() {
  commentSelection()
}

@hotkeySequence(['G', 'Shift+G'])
scrollBottom() {
  window.scrollTo({ top: document.body.scrollHeight, behavior: 'smooth' })
}
```

## Chained modifier chords

This example follows physical R and T positions. Brackets retain those positions even when the keys produce different letters. Other sequences can continue using logical characters.

You can repeat the same modifier across consecutive steps, for example `Shift+R` then `Shift+T`:

```ts
@hotkeySequence(['Shift+[KeyR]', 'Shift+[KeyT]'])
chordSequence() {
  runAfterChords()
}
```

### Modifier-only keys between steps

While a sequence is in progress, the manager ignores modifier-only keydown events (Shift, Control, Alt, or Meta pressed alone, with no letter or other key). They neither advance the sequence nor reset progress. That way a user can tap Shift (or hold it) between chords such as `Shift+R` and `Shift+T` without breaking the sequence, much like Vim-style flows where a modifier may be pressed before the next chord.

## Common sequence patterns

### Vim-style navigation

```ts
@customElement('vim-navigation')
class VimNavigation extends LitElement {
  @hotkeySequence(['G', 'G'])
  goTop() {
    scrollToTop()
  }

  @hotkeySequence(['G', 'Shift+G'])
  goBottom() {
    scrollToBottom()
  }

  @hotkeySequence(['D', 'D'])
  deleteLine() {
    deleteCurrentLine()
  }

  @hotkeySequence(['D', 'W'])
  deleteWord() {
    deleteCurrentWord()
  }

  @hotkeySequence(['C', 'I', 'W'])
  changeInnerWord() {
    changeInnerWordImpl()
  }

  render() {
    return html`<div></div>`
  }
}
```

### Konami code

```ts
@hotkeySequence(
  [
    'ArrowUp',
    'ArrowUp',
    'ArrowDown',
    'ArrowDown',
    'ArrowLeft',
    'ArrowRight',
    'ArrowLeft',
    'ArrowRight',
    'B',
    'A',
  ],
  { timeout: 2000 },
)
enableEasterEgg() {
  showEasterEgg()
}
```

### Multi-step commands

```ts
@hotkeySequence(['H', 'E', 'L', 'P'])
openHelp() {
  showHelp()
}
```

## How sequences work

Both `SequenceManager` and `createSequenceMatcher` ignore modifier-only events, IME composition, and automatic keydown repeats. These events neither advance the sequence nor refresh its timeout: holding G does not complete a two-press G sequence. The manager prefers exact matches over weaker logical-key fallbacks while preserving equally strong matches.

The `SequenceManager` (singleton) handles all sequence registrations. When a key is pressed:

1. It checks if the key matches the next expected step in any registered sequence
2. If it matches, the sequence advances to the next step
3. If the timeout expires between steps, the sequence resets
4. When all steps are completed, the callback fires
5. Modifier-only keydowns are ignored (they neither advance nor reset the sequence)

### Overlapping sequences

Multiple sequences can share the same prefix. The manager tracks progress for each sequence independently:

```ts
@hotkeySequence(['D', 'D'])
dd() {
  deleteLine()
}

@hotkeySequence(['D', 'W'])
dw() {
  deleteWord()
}

@hotkeySequence(['D', 'I', 'W'])
diw() {
  deleteInnerWord()
}
```

After pressing `D`, the manager waits for the next key to determine which sequence to complete.

### Conflicting registrations

For the same target, duplicate detection compares resolved steps: modifier aliases, modifier order, and logical key casing do not create separate bindings. `conflictBehavior` applies to equivalent sequences without rewriting their stored strings. Physical and logical identities remain distinct, and a shared prefix alone is not a duplicate registration. Recorder conflict detection also checks prefixes and observed physical/logical overlap.

## The sequence manager

Under the hood, `@hotkeySequence` and `HotkeySequenceController` use the singleton `SequenceManager`. You can also use the core `createSequenceMatcher` function for standalone sequence matching without the singleton:

```ts
import { createSequenceMatcher } from '@tanstack/lit-hotkeys'

const matcher = createSequenceMatcher(['G', 'G'], {
  timeout: 1000,
})

document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  if (matcher.match(e)) {
    console.log('Sequence completed!')
  }
  console.log('Progress:', matcher.getProgress()) // e.g., 1/2
})
```
