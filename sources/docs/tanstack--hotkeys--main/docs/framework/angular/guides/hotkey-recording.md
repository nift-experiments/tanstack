TanStack Hotkeys provides the `injectHotkeyRecorder` API for building shortcut customization UIs in Angular.

Recorders default to physical codes: recording a shortcut stores a string such as `Mod+[KeyS]`. Pass it directly to your hotkey registration and use `formatForDisplay` for the label. Set `recordBy: 'key'` when you intentionally want the produced character instead.

TanStack Hotkeys automatically suppresses registered hotkey and sequence callbacks while any recorder is active. You do not need to set `enabled` from `isRecording`. Registrations remain available for conflict detection, and recorded keys stay suppressed through repeats and key release.

## Reactive options

Recorder options support [property getters and functions returning options](./hotkeys.md#property-getters). Updated callbacks, validation, and recording settings apply during an active session without restarting it. Allow the framework to run its effect or watcher before relying on the update.

## Basic usage

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import {
  formatForDisplay,
  injectHotkeyRecorder,
} from '@tanstack/angular-hotkeys'

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  template: `
    <button (click)="recorder.isRecording() ? recorder.stopRecording() : recorder.startRecording()">
      {{
        recorder.isRecording()
          ? 'Press a key combination...'
          : recorder.recordedHotkey()
            ? formatForDisplay(recorder.recordedHotkey()!)
            : 'Click to record'
      }}
    </button>
    @if (recorder.isRecording()) {
      <button (click)="recorder.cancelRecording()">Cancel</button>
    }
  `,
})
export class ShortcutRecorderComponent {
  readonly formatForDisplay = formatForDisplay
  readonly recorder = injectHotkeyRecorder({
    onRecord: (hotkey) => {
      console.log('Recorded:', hotkey)
    },
  })
}
```

## Return value

- `isRecording()`: Angular signal getter indicating whether recording is active
- `recordedHotkey()`: Angular signal getter with the most recently recorded hotkey
- `startRecording()`: start listening for key presses
- `stopRecording()`: stop listening and reset recorder state without calling `onRecord`
- `cancelRecording()`: stop listening and discard the in-progress recording

## Options

### `recordBy`

Recorders default to `recordBy: 'code'`. Option+S producing `ß` on macOS records `Alt+[KeyS]`; Option+2 producing `™` records `Alt+[Digit2]`. The stored brackets preserve physical identity through state, serialization, and registration; `formatForDisplay` produces a readable label. There is no code-to-letter conversion. Existing authored strings such as `Mod+S` remain logical bindings.

Set `recordBy: 'key'` to intentionally record the produced logical character. A code-mode event with no usable code is rejected rather than silently switching modes. IME composition is ignored. AltGraph character entry is rejected in code mode; key mode preserves the produced character without synthetic Control/Alt while retaining Shift. Recording events, repeats, and their releases do not trigger registered hotkeys or sequences.

```ts
injectHotkeyRecorder({
  recordBy: 'code', // default; choose 'key' for logical characters
  onRecord: (hotkey) => {},
  onCancel: () => {},
  onClear: () => {},
})
```

## Global defaults via provider

```ts
import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core'
import { provideHotkeys } from '@tanstack/angular-hotkeys'

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHotkeys({
      hotkeyRecorder: {
        onCancel: () => console.log('Recording cancelled'),
      },
    }),
  ],
}
```

### `ignoreInputs`

`HotkeyRecorderOptions` includes an `ignoreInputs` option (defaults to `true`). When `true`, the recorder doesn't intercept normal typing in text inputs, textareas, selects, or contentEditable elements. Keystrokes pass through to the input as usual. Pressing Escape still cancels recording even when an input is focused. Set `ignoreInputs: false` if you want the recorder to capture keys from within input elements.

```ts
injectHotkeyRecorder({
  ignoreInputs: false, // record even from inside inputs
  onRecord: (hotkey) => console.log(hotkey),
})
```

## Recording behavior

- Modifier-only presses do not complete a recording.
- Modifier plus key combinations record the full shortcut.
- Escape cancels recording.
- Backspace and Delete clear the shortcut.
- Recorded values are normalized to portable `Mod` format.

## Validation and conflicts

Both recorder APIs accept `detectConflicts`, `validate`, and `onReject`. For a single-hotkey recorder, these options can be supplied alongside `onRecord`:

```ts
const options = {
  detectConflicts: {
    // Use registration IDs to exclude the binding being edited:
    excludeIds: [registrationId],
    target: document,
    eventType: 'keydown',
  },
  validate: (_hotkey, { parsedHotkey }) =>
    parsedHotkey.modifiers.length > 0 || 'Include a modifier.',
  onReject: ({ reason, message, conflicts }) => {
    // Show feedback; recording stays active.
    console.log(reason, message, conflicts)
  },
}
```

`validate` returns true to accept, or false/a message to reject. `onReject` receives `reason` (`missing-code`, `alt-graph`, `invalid`, `validation`, or `conflict`), a message, the candidate when available, and conflicting registration views for conflict rejections. Validation runs before commit; rejection never falls back to another key identity.

`detectConflicts: true` checks enabled live registrations with the intended event type (default keydown) and overlapping targets (default document). Document/nested scopes can conflict; disjoint widgets can reuse a binding. The options object also supports `scope: 'all'`, `includeDisabled`, and an `exclude(registration)` predicate. Both single bindings and sequence prefixes are checked. Source events detect physical/logical overlap on the recorded layout. This is a conservative collision check, not a promise that two callbacks will execute: propagation, input filtering, match priority, external listeners, unmounted routes, and other layouts can affect actual dispatch.

For checks outside recording, use `findHotkeyConflicts(bindingOrSequence, options)`. Without source `events`, it compares binding identity and sequence prefixes; it does not guess equivalence between a logical character and a physical position.
