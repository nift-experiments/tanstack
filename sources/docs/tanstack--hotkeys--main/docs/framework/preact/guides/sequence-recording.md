TanStack Hotkeys includes the `useHotkeySequenceRecorder` hook for building UIs where users record multi-chord sequences (Vim-style shortcuts). Each step is captured like a single hotkey chord. Users finish with Enter by default, or you can use manual commit and optional idle timeout.

Sequence recording uses `recordBy: 'code'` by default, preserving every step as a physical string such as `['[KeyG]', 'Alt+[KeyS]']`. Set `recordBy: 'key'` for logical characters. The shared rejection and conflict options follow the [hotkey recording guide](./hotkey-recording.md#validation-and-conflicts).

TanStack Hotkeys automatically suppresses registered hotkey and sequence callbacks while any recorder is active. You do not need to set `enabled` from `isRecording`. Registrations remain available for conflict detection, and recorded keys stay suppressed through repeats and key release.

## Basic usage

```tsx
import { useHotkeySequenceRecorder, formatForDisplay } from '@tanstack/preact-hotkeys'
import type { HotkeySequence } from '@tanstack/preact-hotkeys'

function HotkeySequenceRecorder() {
  const recorder = useHotkeySequenceRecorder({
    onRecord: (sequence: HotkeySequence) => {
      console.log('Recorded:', sequence)
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={
          recorder.isRecording ? recorder.cancelRecording : recorder.startRecording
        }
      >
        {recorder.isRecording
          ? 'Press chords, then Enter…'
          : recorder.recordedSequence
            ? recorder.recordedSequence.map((h) => formatForDisplay(h)).join(' ')
            : 'Click to record'}
      </button>
      {recorder.isRecording && (
        <button type="button" onClick={recorder.cancelRecording}>
          Cancel
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Return value

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `isRecording` | `boolean` | Whether the recorder is listening |
| `steps` | `HotkeySequence` | Chords captured in the current session |
| `recordedSequence` | `HotkeySequence \| null` | Last committed sequence |
| `startRecording` | `() => void` | Start a new session |
| `stopRecording` | `() => void` | Stop without calling `onRecord` |
| `cancelRecording` | `() => void` | Stop and call `onCancel` |
| `commitRecording` | `() => void` | Commit current `steps` (no-op if empty) |

## Options

`recordBy` defaults to `'code'`; choose `'key'` for logical characters. Repeats and IME composition never append steps. Modifier-only presses wait for a complete chord.

Core options live on `HotkeySequenceRecorderOptions` from `@tanstack/hotkeys`:

- `onRecord(sequence)`: called when a nonempty sequence is committed. Clearing calls only `onClear`.
- `onCancel`, `onClear`: same intent as the hotkey recorder.
- `commitKeys`: `'enter'` (default) or `'none'`. With `'none'`, only `commitRecording()` (or `idleTimeoutMs`) finishes recording; plain Enter can be recorded as a chord.
- `commitOnEnter`: when `commitKeys` is `'enter'`, set to `false` to treat Enter as a normal chord (then use `commitRecording()` or idle timeout to finish).
- `idleTimeoutMs`: optional milliseconds of inactivity after the last completed chord to auto-commit. The timer does not run while waiting for the first chord.

### Provider defaults

```tsx
<HotkeysProvider
  defaultOptions={{
    hotkeySequenceRecorder: {
      idleTimeoutMs: 2000,
    },
  }}
>
  <App />
</HotkeysProvider>
```

### `ignoreInputs`

The `HotkeySequenceRecorderOptions` supports an `ignoreInputs` option (defaults to `true`). When `true`, the recorder doesn't intercept normal typing in text inputs, textareas, selects, or contentEditable elements. Keystrokes pass through to the input as usual. Pressing Escape still cancels recording even when focused on an input. Set `ignoreInputs: false` if you want the recorder to capture keys from within input elements.

## Validation and conflicts

Sequence `validate(sequence, { events, parsedSequence })` runs when committing and returns true, false, or a rejection message. `detectConflicts` checks sequence prefixes as well as single bindings. Rejected commits keep recording active with the steps intact so the user can edit them with Backspace. Empty Backspace/Delete clears and emits `onClear` only; removing a nonempty step does not commit. Recorded steps, commit keys, and releases are isolated from application handlers.

## Behavior

| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Valid chord | Appended to `steps`; listener stays active |
| Enter (no modifiers), `commitKeys: 'enter'`, `steps.length >= 1` | Commits and calls `onRecord` |
| Escape | Cancels; `onCancel` |
| Backspace / Delete (no modifiers) | Removes last step, or if empty runs only `onClear` and stops |

Recorded chords use portable `Mod` format, same as `HotkeyRecorder`.

## Under the hood

`useHotkeySequenceRecorder` wraps the `HotkeySequenceRecorder` class and subscribes to its TanStack Store, same pattern as `useHotkeyRecorder`.
