title: Scheduling and Recurring Runs
---

`@tanstack/workflow-core` ships no cron daemon. The shape every mature workflow
engine converges on is **external scheduler + durable store + bounded wake-up**.
The JavaScript engine should not stay alive just because a workflow is waiting.

TanStack Workflow now has two scheduling layers:

- `@tanstack/workflow-core`: low-level engine recipes where you bring your own
  scheduler and call `runWorkflow`.
- `@tanstack/workflow-runtime`: registered schedules, timer indexes, schedule
  materialization, and bounded `runtime.sweep()` calls.

For the production runtime model, start with the
[Scheduling section in the Guide](../guide/index.md#wake-timers-and-schedules)
and the [Deployment guide](../guide/deployment.md). This page keeps the
low-level core recipes because they are still useful when embedding the engine
directly.

## The runtime model in one paragraph

You register schedules in `defineWorkflowRuntime`. A host cron or scheduled
function calls the runtime sweep. The sweep materializes due schedules, starts
fresh deterministic runs for due schedule buckets, claims due timers, and resumes
sleeping workflows by delivering the internal `__timer` signal. The store is the
source of truth; cron is only a wake-up tick.

```ts
await workflowRuntime.sweep({
  maxScheduledRuns: 25,
  maxTimers: 25,
  maxDurationMs: 55_000,
  includeEvents: false,
})
```

## The core model in one paragraph

You declare a normal workflow. Something outside the engine (cron daemon,
Cloudflare Cron Trigger, Railway Cron Job, Netlify Scheduled Function,
EventBridge rule, a `setInterval` in a worker, Vercel Cron Job, anything) fires
on schedule. Each tick calls `runWorkflow({ workflow, input, runStore })` with
fresh input. The workflow runs end-to-end and finishes; the next tick is a new
`runId`. No "loop forever with sleep" — log doesn't grow, replay cost is
constant, and "when's the next run?" is answerable from the scheduler, not from
the engine.

## Recipe: a node process with `node-cron`

```ts
import cron from 'node-cron'
import { runWorkflow, inMemoryRunStore } from '@tanstack/workflow-core'
import { dailyReport } from './workflows/daily-report'

const runStore = inMemoryRunStore() // swap for a durable adapter in prod

// 09:00 every Monday in UTC
cron.schedule(
  '0 9 * * MON',
  async () => {
    for await (const _ of runWorkflow({
      workflow: dailyReport,
      input: { triggeredAt: Date.now() },
      runStore,
    })) {
      // events flow through here — forward to Redis, log, ignore
    }
  },
  { timezone: 'UTC' },
)
```

The workflow body itself is a normal one-shot:

```ts
export const dailyReport = createWorkflow({
  id: 'daily-report',
  input: z.object({ triggeredAt: z.number() }),
}).handler(async (ctx) => {
  const report = await ctx.step('gen', generateReport)
  await ctx.step('email', () => emailReport(report))
  return { ranAt: ctx.input.triggeredAt, report: report.summary }
})
```

## Recipe: Cloudflare Worker cron trigger

```toml
# wrangler.toml
[[triggers.crons]]
cron = "0 9 * * MON"
```

```ts
// worker.ts
import { runWorkflow } from '@tanstack/workflow-core'
import { dailyReport } from './workflows/daily-report'
import { d1RunStore } from './storage' // hypothetical D1-backed store

export default {
  async scheduled(event: ScheduledEvent, env: Env) {
    const runStore = d1RunStore(env.DB)
    for await (const _ of runWorkflow({
      workflow: dailyReport,
      input: { triggeredAt: event.scheduledTime },
      runStore,
    })) {
      /* forward / log */
    }
  },
}
```

## Recipe: Railway Cron Job running a command

```ts
// scripts/daily-report.ts
import { runWorkflow } from '@tanstack/workflow-core'
import { dailyReport } from '../workflows/daily-report'
import { runStore } from '../storage'

for await (const _ of runWorkflow({
  workflow: dailyReport,
  input: { triggeredAt: Date.now() },
  runStore,
})) {
  /* log / forward */
}
```

Configure the service's cron schedule in Railway and make the command exit after
the workflow reaches completion or its next pause.

## Recipe: Netlify Scheduled Function

```ts
// netlify/functions/daily-report.ts
import { runWorkflow } from '@tanstack/workflow-core'
import { dailyReport } from '../../src/workflows/daily-report'
import { runStore } from '../../src/storage'

export async function handler() {
  for await (const _ of runWorkflow({
    workflow: dailyReport,
    input: { triggeredAt: Date.now() },
    runStore,
  })) {
    /* … */
  }
  return { statusCode: 200, body: 'ok' }
}

export const config = {
  schedule: '0 9 * * MON',
}
```

## Recipe: AWS EventBridge → Lambda

```yaml
# serverless.yml (excerpt)
functions:
  dailyReport:
    handler: handlers/daily-report.handler
    events:
      - schedule: cron(0 9 ? * MON *) # EventBridge cron syntax — UTC
```

```ts
// handlers/daily-report.ts
import { runWorkflow } from '@tanstack/workflow-core'
import { dailyReport } from '../workflows/daily-report'
import { dynamoRunStore } from '../storage'

export const handler = async () => {
  for await (const _ of runWorkflow({
    workflow: dailyReport,
    input: { triggeredAt: Date.now() },
    runStore: dynamoRunStore(),
  })) {
    /* … */
  }
}
```

## Recipe: Vercel Cron Job hitting a route

```jsonc
// vercel.json
{
  "crons": [{ "path": "/api/cron/daily-report", "schedule": "0 9 * * MON" }]
}
```

```ts
// app/api/cron/daily-report/route.ts (App Router) or pages/api/cron/...
import { runWorkflow } from '@tanstack/workflow-core'
import { dailyReport } from '@/workflows/daily-report'
import { runStore } from '@/lib/run-store'

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  // Vercel signs the request; verify the secret before running
  if (req.headers.get('authorization') !== `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`) {
    return new Response('unauthorized', { status: 401 })
  }
  for await (const _ of runWorkflow({
    workflow: dailyReport,
    input: { triggeredAt: Date.now() },
    runStore,
  })) {
    /* … */
  }
  return new Response('ok')
}
```

## Recipe: skip-overlap policy

Most schedulers (`cron`, EventBridge, Vercel) don't know whether the previous
tick is still running. If you want "skip the new tick if the previous one is
still in flight," gate on a marker in the run store before starting:

```ts
async function tick() {
  // Use a deterministic runId so concurrent ticks can't both create one.
  const runId = `daily-report:${new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)}` // one per day
  const existing = await runStore.getRunState(runId)
  if (existing && existing.status !== 'finished' && existing.status !== 'errored') {
    return // previous tick still running, skip
  }
  for await (const _ of runWorkflow({
    workflow: dailyReport,
    runId,
    input: { triggeredAt: Date.now() },
    runStore,
  })) {
    /* … */
  }
}
```

The engine's start-path idempotency check (same `runId` + same workflow fingerprint = attach-snapshot, not double-start) means a second-of-two concurrent calls degrades to read-only safely even if the gate above races.

## Recipe: buffer-one policy

If you want "if a tick fires while one is running, run it again as soon as the previous finishes," queue locally:

```ts
let pending = false
let inFlight: Promise<void> | null = null

async function tick() {
  if (inFlight) {
    pending = true
    return
  }
  inFlight = (async () => {
    for await (const _ of runWorkflow({ workflow: dailyReport, input: { triggeredAt: Date.now() }, runStore })) {
      /* … */
    }
  })().finally(async () => {
    inFlight = null
    if (pending) {
      pending = false
      await tick()
    }
  })
  await inFlight
}
```

Holds at most one pending tick — extra ticks during a long run collapse into a single follow-up.

## Recipe: writing your own schedule store

For shops that don't have a host-managed cron, run a tiny worker that polls a schedule table:

```ts
interface Schedule {
  id: string
  workflowId: string
  cronExpr: string
  nextFireAt: number
  inputBuilder: () => unknown
  overlapPolicy: 'skip' | 'buffer' | 'allow'
}

async function tickAllSchedules(schedules: Array<Schedule>, runStore: RunStore) {
  const now = Date.now()
  for (const s of schedules) {
    if (s.nextFireAt > now) continue
    await fireOne(s, runStore)
    s.nextFireAt = computeNext(s.cronExpr, now) // use a cron-parser lib
  }
}

// Long-running worker
setInterval(() => tickAllSchedules(schedules, runStore), 30_000)
```

A more durable version persists `nextFireAt` alongside each schedule definition;
a deeper one claims due ticks atomically so duplicate schedulers do not start the
same work twice. `@tanstack/workflow-runtime` provides that newer shape through
registered schedules, schedule buckets, leases, and bounded sweeps. See the
[Guide](../guide/index.md) for the current production path.

## Test pattern

The repo's `tests/examples.external-cron.test.ts` exercises this end-to-end with vitest fake timers — a deterministic scheduler driving multiple ticks against the engine, verifying each tick produces an independent run and that skip-overlap works.
