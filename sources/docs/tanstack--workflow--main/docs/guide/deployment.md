# Deployment

TanStack Workflow is designed for normal deployment targets. A workflow can span
hours or months, but each host invocation should do bounded work and then return.

The host is not the durability boundary. Cloudflare Cron Triggers, Railway Cron
Jobs, Netlify Scheduled Functions, Vercel Cron, queues, and worker alarms only
wake the runtime. The store decides what is due, who can claim it, and whether
the run has already advanced.

TanStack Workflow documentation and adapter work prioritizes partner
environments first: Cloudflare, Railway, and Netlify. Vercel is still supported
as an important compatibility target, but it should not be treated as the default
deployment path.

The deployment recipe is the same everywhere:

1. Put workflow state in a durable store.
2. Start or resume a run from HTTP, queue, webhook, or application code.
3. Use host cron, alarms, or scheduled functions to wake `runtime.sweep()`.
4. Keep every sweep under the host's timeout and memory budget.

## Invocation shapes

Most apps need three entrypoints:

| Entrypoint | Runtime call | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start a run | `runtime.startRun` | User action, API request, queue message |
| Resume a run | `runtime.deliverSignal` or `runtime.deliverApproval` | Webhook, payment event, admin approval |
| Wake background work | `runtime.sweep` | Cron, scheduled function, worker alarm |

Each entrypoint claims a run, drives it to completion or the next pause, and
returns.

## Bounded sweeps

Always budget background sweeps:

```ts
await runtime.sweep({
  maxScheduledRuns: 25,
  maxTimers: 25,
  maxDurationMs: 55_000,
  includeEvents: false,
})
```

Set `maxDurationMs` below the host's real timeout. If the sweep returns
`remainingMayExist: true`, another scheduled tick, queue message, or manual
follow-up can keep draining work.

## Schema setup

Runtime sweeps assume the durable store schema already exists. Host adapters do
not create tables during a cron tick, scheduled function, or worker alarm. That
keeps production behavior explicit: migrations and bootstrap steps belong to the
app deploy/admin process, not the background sweep path.

For the Drizzle/Postgres adapter, Workflow owns the `workflow_*` schema. Apply
the package-owned migration against the same database your deployed functions
use:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f node_modules/@tanstack/workflow-store-drizzle-postgres/migrations/0000_workflow_store.sql
```

For Cloudflare D1, use the D1-compatible package-owned migration artifact:

```txt
node_modules/@tanstack/workflow-store-cloudflare-d1/migrations/0000_workflow_store.sql
```

Wire it into your app scripts if your deploy provider runs package scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "workflow:migrate": "psql \"$DATABASE_URL\" -f node_modules/@tanstack/workflow-store-drizzle-postgres/migrations/0000_workflow_store.sql",
    "workflow:sweep": "tsx scripts/workflow-sweep.ts"
  }
}
```

Do not copy Workflow's internal table declarations into your app Drizzle schema.
Keep app code focused on workflow definitions and host entrypoints. Keep
`store.ensureSchema()` for tests, local demos, and explicit admin bootstrap
scripts.

The migration creates `workflow_schema_migrations` so future store schema changes
can be tracked as package-owned numbered migrations. Apply new store migrations
before rolling out a store adapter version that expects them.

## Cloudflare

Cloudflare can run the same runtime shape with a Worker `scheduled()` handler:

```ts
import { createCloudflareWorkflowScheduledHandler } from '@tanstack/workflow-cloudflare'

export default {
  scheduled: createCloudflareWorkflowScheduledHandler({
    runtime: ({ env }) => createWorkflowRuntime(env),
    maxScheduledRuns: 25,
    maxTimers: 25,
    maxDurationMs: 25_000,
  }),
}
```

Cloudflare-specific store adapters are separate work. The current deployment
POC proves the host shape with Workers and Durable Objects.

### Cloudflare notes

- Cron Triggers wake due work through `scheduled()`.
- Durable Objects, D1, Queues, and Workers are natural adapter targets.
- Keep each scheduled invocation bounded and let the store decide what is due.

## Railway

Railway Cron Jobs run a service on a crontab expression. The service should do
bounded sweep work and then exit.

Create a small sweep command:

```ts
// scripts/workflow-sweep.ts
import { createRailwayWorkflowCronCommand } from '@tanstack/workflow-railway'
import { workflowRuntime } from '../src/workflows/runtime.server'

const sweep = createRailwayWorkflowCronCommand({
  runtime: workflowRuntime,
  maxScheduledRuns: 25,
  maxTimers: 25,
  maxDurationMs: 55_000,
  logSummary: true,
})

await sweep()
```

Configure the Railway service with config-as-code:

```toml
# railway.toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "pnpm workflow:sweep"
cronSchedule = "*/5 * * * *"
restartPolicyType = "NEVER"
```

Or with JSON:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.com/railway.schema.json",
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "pnpm workflow:sweep",
    "cronSchedule": "*/5 * * * *",
    "restartPolicyType": "NEVER"
  }
}
```

Use the same durable store as the rest of your app.

### Railway notes

- Cron Jobs run the service start command on a schedule and expect the process
  to terminate when the task is done.
- Railway supports `railway.toml` and `railway.json` config-as-code for deploy
  settings, including `startCommand` and `cronSchedule`.
- Railway skips a cron run if the previous one is still running, so the store
  still needs leases and idempotency for correctness.
- Railway cron schedules use UTC and cannot run more frequently than every five
  minutes.
- Railway Postgres is a natural first durable store for app-embedded workflows.

## Netlify

Install:

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/workflow-netlify
```

Create a Scheduled Function:

```ts
// netlify/functions/workflow-sweep-background.ts
import {
  createNetlifyWorkflowSweepHandler,
} from '@tanstack/workflow-netlify'
import { workflowRuntime } from '../../src/workflows/runtime.server'

export default createNetlifyWorkflowSweepHandler({
  runtime: workflowRuntime,
  maxScheduledRuns: 25,
  maxTimers: 25,
  maxDurationMs: 25_000,
})

export const config = {
  schedule: '*/5 * * * *',
}
```

The adapter returns a compact summary:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "summary": {
    "materialized": 1,
    "scheduled": { "completed": 1 },
    "timers": {},
    "eventCount": 8,
    "returnedEventCount": 0
  },
  "deadlineReached": false,
  "remainingMayExist": false
}
```

Use `includeSweepResult: true` only for debugging because it can return large
event arrays.

### Netlify notes

- Scheduled Functions are wake-up ticks.
- Published deploys own scheduled function execution.
- Deploy Previews do not auto-tick scheduled functions. Use Netlify's manual
  "Run now" action to test the path before publishing.
- Use a durable external store such as Postgres, Netlify Database, Neon, or
  another store adapter.
- Apply the store adapter's package-owned migration during deploy/setup. The
  scheduled function should only own host config and the sweep handler.
- Keep `maxDurationMs` below the function timeout.

## Vercel

Install:

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/workflow-vercel
```

Create a route handler:

```ts
// app/api/workflow/sweep/route.ts
import { createVercelWorkflowSweepHandler } from '@tanstack/workflow-vercel'
import { workflowRuntime } from '@/workflows/runtime.server'

export const runtime = 'nodejs'
export const maxDuration = 60

export const GET = createVercelWorkflowSweepHandler({
  runtime: workflowRuntime,
  cronSecret: process.env.CRON_SECRET,
  maxScheduledRuns: 25,
  maxTimers: 25,
  maxDurationMs: 55_000,
})
```

Configure `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/workflow/sweep",
      "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

When `CRON_SECRET` is configured, Vercel sends:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>
```

The adapter validates that header when you pass `cronSecret`.

### Vercel notes

- Vercel Cron invokes the route with HTTP `GET`.
- Cron should wake the runtime, not hold workflow state.
- Vercel Hobby projects are limited to daily cron cadence. For minute-level
  sweeps, use a plan that supports the cadence or call the sweep through another
  scheduler.
- Use a durable external store such as Postgres. Function memory is not a store.
- Apply the store adapter's package-owned migration during deploy/setup. The
  route should only own host config and the sweep handler.

## Choosing a sweep cadence

Sweep cadence is a product decision:

| Need | Suggested cadence |
| --- | --- |
| Daily digest or report | Daily or hourly |
| User-visible delayed actions | Every minute |
| Near-real-time timers | Queue plus frequent sweeps |
| Rare long sleeps | Coarse cron plus manual/event wake-ups |

The cadence controls how quickly due work is noticed. The store still controls
whether work is due and whether a worker can claim it.

## Queue integration

Queues are optional. They are useful for:

- fanning out heavy work after a sweep finds many due items
- retrying webhook delivery
- waking another sweep when `remainingMayExist` is true
- distributing starts and signals across workers

They are not the durability boundary. A queue message should point at a run,
timer, schedule bucket, or signal. The store remains the source of truth.

## Failure model

Assume:

- cron can deliver late
- cron can deliver twice
- a function can crash after a side effect
- a worker can time out before releasing a lease
- a webhook can retry
- a deploy can happen while runs are paused

The runtime/store model handles this with leases, idempotency keys, stable
workflow versions, and replay. Your application still needs idempotent external
side effects.

## Deployment checklist

- Configure a durable store and run schema migrations.
- Keep workflow loaders available for old versions.
- Add one sweep entrypoint per deployment target.
- Set host timeout and `maxDurationMs` together.
- Keep sweep event arrays disabled by default.
- Log `summary`, `deadlineReached`, and `remainingMayExist`.
- Alert on repeated stale lease recovery, sweep errors, and growing due timers.
- Smoke test start, sleep, timer sweep, signal delivery, and attach/read flows.
