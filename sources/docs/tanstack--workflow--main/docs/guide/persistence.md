# Persistence

Durability is the difference between "an async function" and "a workflow." In
TanStack Workflow, durability lives in an explicit store contract.

The store is responsible for the facts that must survive process exits,
deployments, retries, and concurrent workers.

## Two store layers

There are two related store shapes:

| Store | Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RunStore` | `@tanstack/workflow-core` | The low-level replay store used directly by `runWorkflow`. |
| `WorkflowExecutionStore` | `@tanstack/workflow-runtime` | The production runtime store for runs, events, timers, schedules, signals, approvals, leases, and timelines. |

Use `RunStore` when embedding the core engine yourself. Use
`WorkflowExecutionStore` when using `defineWorkflowRuntime`.

## What persists

The runtime store persists:

- **Runs**: `runId`, `workflowId`, `workflowVersion`, status, input, output, and
  error.
- **Run state**: the replay metadata needed by the core engine, including
  `awaiting[]` plus current single-wait projections for hosts.
- **Events**: the append-only workflow event log.
- **Timers**: due wake-ups for `ctx.sleep` and `ctx.sleepUntil`.
- **Signals**: delivered external events with idempotency.
- **Approvals**: delivered approval decisions with idempotency.
- **Schedules**: registered recurring workflow definitions.
- **Schedule buckets**: due schedule ticks that can be claimed and started.
- **Leases**: ownership records for active work and stale recovery.

The store does not persist JavaScript functions. It persists stable identifiers
and data. Workflow code is loaded by runtime registrations.

## Append-only event log

The event log is the source of truth for replay. Durable primitives append
events such as:

- `STEP_FINISHED`
- `STEP_FAILED`
- `SIGNAL_AWAITED`
- `SIGNAL_RESOLVED`
- `APPROVAL_REQUESTED`
- `APPROVAL_RESOLVED`
- `NOW_RECORDED`
- `UUID_RECORDED`
- `RUN_FINISHED`
- `RUN_ERRORED`

Stores append with `expectedNextIndex`. That compare-and-swap boundary prevents
two writers from committing conflicting event histories for the same run.

## Run state

Run state is the small routing record beside the log. It answers questions like:

- Is the run queued, running, paused, finished, or errored?
- Which workflow version started this run?
- Which awaitables are currently outstanding?
- Is the run waiting for a signal?
- Is the run waiting for an approval?
- Is there a timer deadline?

Replay still comes from the event log. Run state makes routing and wake-ups
efficient. `waitingFor` and `pendingApproval` are convenient projections for
today's one-pause-at-a-time engine. The `awaiting[]` array is the forward-facing
shape for future fan-out, race, or multiple outstanding wait primitives.

## Timers

`ctx.sleep` and `ctx.sleepUntil` pause the workflow on an internal `__timer`
signal. The runtime persists a timer row with `wakeAt`.

Later, `runtime.sweep()` claims due timers and delivers the internal signal:

```ts
await runtime.sweep({
  maxTimers: 25,
  includeEvents: false,
})
```

The host only wakes the runtime. The store decides which timers are actually
due.

## Schedules

Registered schedules are materialized into schedule buckets:

```ts
workflows: {
  digest: {
    load: async () => digestWorkflow,
    schedules: [
      {
        id: 'digest-every-15m',
        schedule: every.minutes(15),
        overlapPolicy: 'skip',
        input: { batchSize: 100 },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

`materializeWorkflowSchedules` computes the due fire time and upserts the
schedule record. The sweep then claims due buckets and starts deterministic run
IDs.

This avoids "infinite sleep loop" workflows for recurring jobs. Each scheduled
tick is a fresh run.

## Leases

Leases let many workers safely share one store.

When a worker wants to execute work, it claims the run, timer, or schedule
bucket with:

- `leaseOwner`
- `leaseMs`
- `now`

If the worker finishes, it releases the lease. If it crashes, another worker can
claim stale work after the lease expires.

Use leases to reduce concurrent execution. Use idempotency to protect external
side effects.

## Idempotency

Workflow idempotency has several layers:

- `runId`: starting the same run twice should not create two executions.
- `stepCtx.id`: use this as the idempotency key for external side effects.
- `signalId`: webhook retries should deliver the same signal once.
- `approvalId`: approval retries should deliver the same approval once.
- schedule bucket IDs: the same scheduled tick should start the same run.

Do not rely on cron providers to deliver exactly once. Assume duplicate delivery
is possible.

## Drizzle/Postgres adapter

The Drizzle/Postgres adapter implements `WorkflowExecutionStore`:

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres'
import { Pool } from 'pg'
import { createDrizzlePostgresWorkflowStore } from '@tanstack/workflow-store-drizzle-postgres'

const db = drizzle(new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL }))
const store = createDrizzlePostgresWorkflowStore({
  db,
  schema: 'public',
})
```

Apply the package-owned migration during setup/deploy:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f node_modules/@tanstack/workflow-store-drizzle-postgres/migrations/0000_workflow_store.sql
```

Workflow owns the `workflow_*` table definitions, indexes, leases, timers,
schedules, and compatibility expectations. Apps should not copy those tables
into their own Drizzle schema for normal runtime use.

`ensureSchema()` is still useful for local demos, tests, and explicit admin
bootstrap scripts. Runtime sweeps and host adapters do not call it for you. A
missing table during `runtime.sweep()` means the deployed database has not been
migrated yet, not that the host adapter failed.

You can override table names:

```ts
const store = createDrizzlePostgresWorkflowStore({
  db,
  tables: {
    runs: 'app_workflow_runs',
    events: 'app_workflow_events',
  },
})
```

The default tables include runs, run states, event locks, events, timers, signal
deliveries, schedules, and schedule buckets.

Future schema changes are versioned with
`@tanstack/workflow-store-drizzle-postgres`. Apply new package migrations as part
of upgrading the store package. The runtime assumes the database schema is
compatible with the installed store adapter version.

The first migration also creates `workflow_schema_migrations` and records the
applied migration ID. Future store migrations will be published as additional
numbered SQL files and should be applied in order before the new adapter version
handles production traffic.

## Retention

Terminal runs usually remain for some period so:

- attach/read APIs can show final results
- webhook retries can remain idempotent
- debugging has a timeline
- metrics and audits can be extracted

Retention policy belongs to the store or an admin job. A production store should
eventually expose cleanup helpers for terminal runs and old events.

## Production requirements

A production-quality store should provide:

- atomic event append
- atomic claim and lease operations
- due timer indexes
- due schedule bucket indexes
- idempotent signal and approval delivery
- stale lease recovery
- migration-safe schema management
- query APIs for dashboards and support tools

Postgres can do all of this in one portable substrate, which is why it is the
first serious store target.
