# Extensions

Extensions are small synchronous hooks for profile-specific syntax. They are intentionally narrower than a general content-processing pipeline.

```ts
import type { MarkdownExtension } from '@tanstack/markdown'

const extension: MarkdownExtension = {
  name: 'example',
  parseBlock(context) {
    return undefined
  },
  transformInline(nodes) {
    return nodes
  },
  transformDocument(document) {
    return document
  },
  renderHtml(node, context) {
    return undefined
  },
}
```

## Block parsing

`parseBlock` runs before built-in block parsing at the current source line. Return `undefined` when the extension does not own that line. When returning a node, call `context.consume(count)` with the number of source lines consumed.

The context includes:

- `lines` and the current `index`
- the active parse `options`
- `parseInline(value)` for inline children
- `parseBlocks(value)` for nested block content
- `consume(lines)` for advancing the parent parser

Nested parsing shares the parser depth budget and heading slugger.

## Inline source parsing

Use `inlineParser` when syntax must see source characters before they become emphasis, links, or decoded escapes. `transformInline` cannot recover an escaped opener or the original spelling of an already-parsed node.

```ts
import type { MarkdownExtension } from '@tanstack/markdown'

const issueReferences: MarkdownExtension = {
  name: 'issue-references',
  inlineParser: {
    markers: '#',
    parse({ source, index, inLink }) {
      if (inLink) return undefined
      const match = /^#([0-9]+)\b/.exec(source.slice(index))
      if (!match) return undefined
      return {
        length: match[0].length,
        node: {
          type: 'link',
          href: `/issues/${match[1]}`,
          children: [{ type: 'text', value: match[0] }],
        },
      }
    },
  },
}
```

`markers` lists literal possible starting UTF-16 code units, not a regular expression or a list of Unicode code points. An emoji contributes its surrogate code units: a callback may also be called for another character sharing one of those units. Always check the complete syntax with `source.startsWith(token, index)` or equivalent, and consume its UTF-16 length. The parser skips ordinary text to the next built-in or extension marker. At a matching position, extensions run in array order after built-in escapes and code spans, before the other built-in inline rules. The first returned result owns that range. Return `undefined` to let the next extension or built-in rule handle it.

The context provides `source`, `index`, `options`, `inLink`, and a nested `parseInline(value)` helper. Source and UTF-16 indices refer to the current inline container, not offsets in the original document. Hooks also run within emphasis and explicit link labels; `inLink` remains true through their nested content. They do not run inside code, image alt text, or link destinations. A hook cannot consume across an enclosing inline or block boundary.

Return one standard `InlineNode` and a positive integer `length` within the remaining source. Invalid lengths throw `RangeError`. The child parser shares the existing depth and scan limits; use that helper instead of calling the top-level parser recursively. Hook dispatch counts against the scan budget. Extension code remains trusted: these limits do not bound work done inside a callback. Keep recognition deterministic and avoid repeatedly scanning a suffix after unsuccessful matches.

Returned nodes follow the same trust contract as supplied ASTs: URL destinations and component names/properties must be validated by the extension. The fixed, numeric issue path above needs no user-supplied URL. Extensions accepting arbitrary URLs should use the application URL policy. Return a portable `InlineComponentNode` for custom presentation; no HTML renderer changes are required.

## Inline transformation

`transformInline` receives built-in and extension inline nodes after parsing. Return the replacement array. Keep transforms deterministic and avoid repeated full-array scans for every node.

The hook runs once per inline container. Recurse through inline `children` when your transform also needs to handle content inside emphasis or links. Code spans and image alt text are not separate inline containers.

## Document transformation

`transformDocument` runs after all blocks and footnotes are built. Return a new `MarkdownDocument`, mutate and return nothing, or leave the document unchanged. The built-in heading collector uses this phase.

## HTML rendering

`renderHtml` runs before built-in HTML node rendering. Return a string to claim the node or `undefined` to continue with the standard renderer. The context can render nested block and inline nodes.

This hook is HTML-specific. Returned HTML is trusted and is not sanitized.

## Custom components

Use `ComponentNode` for block content and `InlineComponentNode` for inline content. Both carry a `name`, source `attributes`, rendered string `properties`, and an optional `tagName`. Inline components have inline `children`, so they can appear in paragraphs, headings, links, and table cells without adding block wrappers.

```ts
import type { InlineComponentNode } from '@tanstack/markdown'

const badge: InlineComponentNode = {
  type: 'inlineComponent',
  name: 'status',
  tagName: 'md-status',
  attributes: {},
  properties: { 'data-state': 'ready' },
  children: [{ type: 'text', value: 'Ready' }],
}
```

An inline transform can return this node alongside ordinary text. The HTML renderer emits `<md-status data-state="ready">Ready</md-status>`. React and Octane use the same tag by default; map `'md-status'` through their `components` option to replace it. An HTML `renderHtml` hook can replace the same node for non-framework output.

Without `tagName`, inline components fall back to `<span>` and block components to `<md-comment-component>`, with `data-component` and JSON `data-attributes`. Values and text children are escaped. Tag and property names come from trusted extension code, not untrusted Markdown. Choose phrasing tags and inline-compatible replacements for inline nodes.

These nodes are JSON-serializable and do not require `allowHtml`. Math parsing and rendering can use them in an opt-in extension, but neither a math parser nor a rendering engine is included in the core.

## Ordering

Extensions run in array order. Put more specific parsers before more general parsers, and use stable extension arrays for parsing and source-string rendering:

```ts
const extensions = [callouts, customComponents]
const document = parseMarkdown(source, { extensions })
const html = renderHtml(document, { extensions })
```

Document transforms are already represented in a pre-parsed AST. HTML render hooks still need to be present when that AST is rendered.

## Admission rule

An extension is appropriate when syntax is broadly useful to docs, has a deterministic source boundary, and does not justify cost in the core entry. Use a larger processing ecosystem when the job requires async plugins, arbitrary tree pipelines, compiler integration, or MDX evaluation.
