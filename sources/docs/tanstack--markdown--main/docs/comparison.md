# Comparison

Markdown libraries optimize for different jobs. TanStack Markdown is designed for controlled blog and documentation content where bundle size, deterministic rendering, and HTML/framework parity matter more than complete syntax compatibility.

## Decision table

| Choose | Best fit | Main tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TanStack Markdown** | Blogs and docs with a known syntax profile, SSR, React or Octane, and strict bundle budgets | Deliberately incomplete CommonMark/GFM coverage and a small extension surface |
| **Marked** | A compact general HTML renderer with broad familiar Markdown behavior | No built-in UI adapter over a docs-specific AST contract |
| **markdown-it** | Mature plugins and configurable parsing rules | A substantially larger core for this measured use case |
| **micromark** | Standards-oriented tokenization and extension building blocks | Lower-level API and more assembly for a complete docs renderer |
| **commonmark.js** | Applications that prioritize CommonMark behavior and an inspectable syntax tree | Larger bundle and no built-in UI framework adapter |
| **unified / remark / rehype** | Rich syntax-tree transformations and a broad content-processing ecosystem | More packages, configuration, and runtime surface |
| **markdown-wasm** | Very fast HTML rendering where a WASM asset is acceptable | Different deployment model and no built-in UI framework adapter |

## Capability matrix

| Capability | TanStack Markdown | Marked | markdown-it | micromark | commonmark.js | unified stack |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| HTML rendering | Built in | Built in | Built in | Built in | Built in | Via rehype |
| React and Octane renderers from the same AST | Built in | No | No | No | No | Ecosystem |
| Serializable public document AST | Built in | Token output | Token stream | No syntax tree | Built in | Built in |
| Raw HTML disabled by default | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | No | Pipeline choice |
| GFM tables, tasks, and strike | Focused built-ins | Built in | Built in/plugins | Extensions | No | Plugins |
| Docs callouts, tabs, and code metadata | Opt-in built-ins | Plugins/custom | Plugins/custom | Custom | Custom | Plugins/custom |
| General plugin ecosystem | Focused hooks | Mature | Mature | Composable extensions | Small | Extensive |
| MDX or JSX evaluation | No | No | No | No | No | Separate MDX stack |
| Full compatibility as a project goal | No | Broad compatibility | Broad compatibility | CommonMark | CommonMark | CommonMark plus plugins |

“Configuration,” “plugin,” and “ecosystem” do not imply missing capability. They indicate that the behavior is not the default contract of the compared entry point.

## Measured browser size

These repository benchmarks bundle representative browser entry points from pinned dependencies, minify them with esbuild, and compress them. They are reproducible with `pnpm run size`.

The comparison does not represent equivalent feature sets. It shows the cost of each measured path for this repository’s rendering benchmark. See the generated [size report](https://github.com/TanStack/markdown/blob/main/reports/sizes.md) for exact bytes and versions.

## Compatibility accounting

The generated [compatibility report](https://github.com/TanStack/markdown/blob/main/reports/conformance.md) tracks matches against all 652 CommonMark 0.31.2 examples after serializer normalization. Every established match is protected individually by the regression suite. The count is accounting, not a conformance claim or a target to maximize. Selected official GFM examples separately cover tables, task lists, and strikethrough.

Use [commonmark.js](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js), micromark, or a unified pipeline when exact specification behavior is a requirement. Use TanStack Markdown when your corpus fits the [documented profile](./core-concepts/syntax-profile.md) and the smaller, controlled renderer is the better product tradeoff.

## Performance

Across the maintained fixtures, TanStack Markdown is competitive with the JavaScript renderers in the suite, but it is not the fastest result in every fixture. Pre-parsed AST rendering is its cheapest path. The defensible advantage is the combined size, output contract, and focused feature set. See [Performance](./guides/performance.md) for methodology and current results.
